# Vallin
This will eventually be a compendium for my homebrew D&amp;D 5e world, Vallin, for now its just a big list of links to all the articles. Eventually it will have more structure and serve as a guide to Vallin. This will include: 

Comprehensive references for:
- All of the player content; races, feats, classes, spells and the deities you might need to access them, etc.

- Some game rules, specifically the variant-rules that Vallin uses.

- Any homebrewed content. There isn't much, the major ones are the Artificer class and Dragonborn race. Pretty much everything else is stock 2014 5e content from one of the sourcebooks I use.

- A character-world guide. Learn about all the cultures, history, geography, and lore that Vallin has to offer! Or, just get the specific parts relevant to a race, background, and class for building a character and developing their backstory.
