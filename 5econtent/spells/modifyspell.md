- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (your spellbook)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

---
Using arcane formulas in your Spellbook, you magically alter one Arcane spell you have prepared. You can change the spell's color, sound, and smell, and you make one of the following modifications to the spell:

Components. Remove one of the spell's components: Verbal, Somatic, or Material. You can't remove the Material component of a spell that consumes that component. 

Concentration. If the spell requires Concentration, damage can't break your Concentration on the spell. 

Damage Type. If the spell has a damage type, replace it with one of the following types: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Necrotic, Poison, or Thunder. If the spell has multiple damage types, you can change only one of them. 

Range. If the spell has a range of at least 5 feet and doesn't have a range of Self, increase its range by a number of feet equal to 30 times your Wizard level. 

Ritual. If the spell lacks the Ritual tag and has a casting time of at least 10 minutes, give it the Ritual tag. 

Targets. If the spell affects one or more creatures and doesn't have a range of Self, it now affects only your allies or enemies (choose which when you cast Modify Spell).

The chosen alteration lasts until you cast Modify Spell again or you finish a Long Rest. This altered version of the spell can't be added to a spellbook or Spell Scroll without first casting Create Spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a Spell Slot of 5th level or higher, you can choose an additional spell modification for each slot level above 4th.

**Classes:** Wizard
