## Scribe Spell
*1st-level transmutation (ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 2 hours
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a quill, a book, and 50 GP of fine inks per level of the scribed spell)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

---
Channeling magic through quill and ink, you scribe an Arcane spell in your spellbook or a blank book worth at least 50 GP. The scribed spell must be of a level for which you have Spell Slots, and the book must lack the spell. 

As you magically scribe the spell, you must copy it from another spellbook or a Spell Scroll, or you must have it prepared. If you copy it from a Spell Scroll, the scroll is destroyed. If you have the spell prepared, the casting time and component costs are halved. 

When the scribing is complete, the spell becomes one of your known spells in the book, appearing on its own page if the book was out of pages. The spell appears in a cipher that is understandable only to you or someone casting Identify or Scribe Spell, and if the book was blank before the scribing, that book is now your spellbook.

**Classes:** Wizard
