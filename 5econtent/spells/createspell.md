## Create Spell
*5th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, in response to yourself casting Modify Spell
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (an arcane focus, which the spell consumes, worth at least 1,000 GP per level of the spell altered by Modify Spell)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

---
Synthesizing your arcane knowledge and power, you strive to create a new spell. To succeed, you must concentrate for 1 hour and meditate on the spell you just altered with Modify Spell, otherwise this spell fails. If you succeed, you must start casting Scribe Spell within the next 10 minutes and add the altered spell to your spellbook. Once the spell is in your spellbook, it becomes one of your known spells, it gains the Wizard source tag rather than the Arcane tag, and it gains a name of your choice.

**Classes:** Wizard
