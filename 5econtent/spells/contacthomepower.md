*2nd-level conjuration (ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Special
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small horn)
- **Duration:** Up to 1 week

---
You blow a small horn and call to your deity. This

establishes a tenuous link through the astral plane

between you and your deity or their seat of power. For

the duration of this spell, you can regain spell slots as

you normally would. When you complete this ritual,

you regain all spell slots of 3rd level or higher that you

didn't regain on your last long rest.

If your deity has abandoned a sphere, either through

force or of their own choosing, this spell will fail. The

caster will learn from the spell whether their god isn't

willing to return to this sphere or if another god is

blocking their return to this sphere. Repeated attempts

may call unwanted attention upon the caster.

**Classes:** Cleric, Paladin
