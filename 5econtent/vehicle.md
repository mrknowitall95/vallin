- **Sails.** The ship has three 80-foot-tall masts with sails to catch the wind and oars on the lower deck for rowing.

#### Example Crew

A warship requires a large crew to properly sail the vessel. Warships carry extra soldiers to fight battles and fire the siege weapons. If the characters are guests on a warship, the crew consists of the following creatures, all of which have proficiency with water vehicles in addition to their normal statistics:

- One captain (**bandit captain**)
- Four other officers: a first mate, a bosun, a quartermaster, and a cook (**nobles**)
- Twenty-five sailors (**commoners**)

A warship typically includes the following additional crew to augment its fighting ability:

- Forty soldiers (**guards**)
- Eight siege engineers (**guards**)
- One **priest** (the ship's surgeon)

#### 1. Main Deck

The main deck of the ship has the following features:

- **Hatch.** A covered, 10-foot-square opening leads to the lower deck (area W8).
- **Railing.** The main deck has a 3-foot-high rail around its perimeter that provides half cover for Medium creatures and three-quarters cover for Small creatures behind it.
- **Rowboats.** Four rowboats are stacked on top of each other on this deck. Ropes and pulleys can hoist these boats in and out of the water.

#### 2. Officers' Quarters

Four beds stand in the officer's quarters. Beneath each is an iron footlocker that holds the officers' belongings. The officers sleep in shifts so someone remains on duty to command the crew and carry out the captain's orders.

#### 3. Captain's Quarters

The captain's quarters hold a bed and a desk. Beneath the bed is an iron footlocker that holds the captain's belongings.

#### 4. Siege Weapon Ammunition

Benches line the walls of this room. Four holes carved in them house chamber pots.

#### 10. Medical Cabin

Hooks and shelves on the walls hold medical instruments, bandages, balms, tonics, jars of leeches, and more, ready to treat injuries from combat or sailing mishaps.

#### 11. Brig

This cabin is meant for guests and visiting high-ranking officials along for the journey. Since warships often have a greater need to house prisoners rather than guests, each bed aboard such a vessel also has a set of *manacles* (see chapter 5 in the Player's Handbook) attached to its frame.

#### 12. Hold

This area houses both passengers and cargo. The ship's off-duty crew sleep on bedrolls among the crates and barrels of food, water, and other supplies.

### Info

Galleys are long vessels that rely on sails and sizable rowing crews to move. These ships can carry siege weapons and soldiers to war or transport large amounts of cargo for merchants. No matter the ship's purpose, the crew almost always hires extra protection, since galleys make large, cargo-rich targets for pirates.

A galley has the following features:

- **Ceilings.** The ceiling of the galley's lower deck is 8 feet high.
- **Light.** Hanging lanterns cast bright light throughout the ship.
- **Rigging.** Rigging on the ship can be climbed without an ability check.

#### Example Galley Crew

A galley requires a crew of eighty to properly sail or row the vessel and might carry extra passengers or soldiers. If the characters are guests on a galley, the crew consists of the following creatures, all of which have proficiency with water vehicles in addition to their normal statistics:

- One captain (**bandit captain**)
- Five other officers: a first mate, a bosun, a quartermaster, a surgeon, and a cook (**scouts**)
- Forty-two sailors (**commoners**)
- Twelve siege engineers (**guards**)
- Twenty **guards**

- **Timpani.** A timpani with two attached mallets sits on the aft of the main deck just before the opening to the lower deck. A crew member plays this instrument while the sailors on the lower deck row, the beat helping to synchronize the rowers' strokes.
- **Wheel.** The ship's wheel stands at the aft of the deck.

#### Lower Deck

The cramped lower deck of the galley ship reeks of body odor and has the following features:

- **Cargo Holds.** Cargo holds at the fore and aft of the lower deck hold crates, barrels, and ammunition secured with rope.

### Info

Wasp ships are lightweight wooden vessels capable of landing safely on the ground, but not on water. They appeal to adventurers because they're affordable and don't require a large crew. Pirates like them because they're swift. Aristocrats are fond of using them as flying yachts because the ship's cargo hold can be easily converted into posh living quarters.
The ship's raised back provides high ground for a weapon emplacement, which is typically equipped with a ballista.

|                             |                                |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Armor Class:** 17 (stone) | **Cargo:** 20 tons             |
| **Hit Points:** 300         | **Crew:** 10 (**beholders**)   |
| **Damage Threshold:** 20    | **Keel/Beam:** 100 ft./100 ft. |
| **Speed:** fly 40 ft.       | **Cost:** —                    |

### 3 Eyestalk Cannons (Crew: 1 each)

**Armor Class:** —

**Hit Points:** —

**Cost:** — (included in ship cost)

This weapon looks like an eye mounted on an eyestalk. A beholder stationed in one of the tyrant ship's meditation pods can see through the eye by concentrating on it (as if concentrating on a spell) and use an action to make the following attack.

***Destructive Ray.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:*  +8 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. *Hit:* 35 (10d6) force damage.

### Info

**Beholders** carve tyrant ships out of stone using their disintegration rays and use these ships to wander the Astral Plane, looking for worlds to conquer and rival beholders to destroy. No two tyrant ships look alike, but they all have one or more features reminiscent of their creators, such as a bulbous shape and eyestalks.
A spherical chamber on the ship's command deck functions as a *spelljamming helm* that only beholders can attune to. Any beholder that occupies this chamber can attune to it. Reducing a tyrant ship to 0 hit points not only destroys it but also destroys the ship's *spelljamming helm* and eyestalk cannons.
A tyrant ship can't float on water, but it can safely land on the ground.

### Info

A turtle ship is encased in a protective metal shell, as befits its name, and bristles with weapons. In addition to its roomy quarters, it can carry a decent-sized payload, making it popular among traders and others who need a lot of cargo space. The ship can land on the ground, and it floats on water. Sliding panels can be closed to make the hull airtight, enabling the ship to travel underwater safely, even to great depths. If the ship takes damage while on or under the water, interior hatches can be sealed to prevent the ship from flooding completely.
Standard weaponry on a turtle ship includes three forward-mounted ballistae and a rear-facing mangonel. These weapons can't be used while the ship is underwater.

### Info

Star moths are ships constructed and flown by astral elves, who don't like it when these ships end up in the hands of others.
A star moth's hull is fashioned from a grown and sculpted organic substance, and its enormous, decorative wings are made of shimmering crystal. The vessel is built for space travel, but its design does enable it to float on water or land safely on the ground. Standard weaponry includes two ballistae nestled in the star moth's eye holes and a mangonel mounted above the bridge.

**Hit Points:** —

**Cost:** — (included in ship cost)

The ship's spelljammer can make the following attack when the ship runs into another object or into a Gargantuan creature (see "Crashing" in chapter 2 of Astral Adventurer's Guide).

***Piercing Ram.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:*  +8 to hit, range 0 ft. one object or Gargantuan creature. *Hit:* 88 (16d10) piercing damage. The squid ship takes half as much damage and comes to a dead stop. *Miss:* The attack deals no damage, the target moves into the nearest unoccupied space that isn't in the squid ship's path, and the squid ship can continue moving if it has any movement left.

### Info

Among the oldest types of spelljamming vessels, squid ships are popular with privateers and are often used as patrol ships. Standard weapons on a squid ship include a forward-mounted mangonel, two aft-mounted ballistae, and a reinforced bow for ramming. The tentacles that extend from the bow account for nearly half the ship's keel length.
Squid ships can float and sail on water, and they can land on the ground.

## Space Galleon

### Info

The space galleon is a mainstay among the host of vessels that ply Wildspace and the Astral Sea. Space galleons can easily pass for ordinary seafaring galleons. Because they can land on water and move across it like their namesakes, they can sail into ports on terrestrial worlds without attracting undue attention. Like an ordinary galleon, a space galleon isn't built to land on the ground (its keel would cause it to roll on its side). The ship's standard weaponry includes two forward-mounted ballistae and an aft-mounted mangonel.

## Shrike Ship

|                            |                               |

### Piercing Ram

**Armor Class:** —

**Hit Points:** —

**Cost:** — (included in ship cost)

The ship's spelljammer can make the following attack when the ship runs into another object or into a Gargantuan creature (see "*Crashing*" earlier in the chapter).

***Piercing Ram.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:*  +8 to hit, range 0 ft., one object or Gargantuan creature. *Hit:* 88 (16d10) piercing damage. The shrike ship takes half as much damage and comes to a dead stop. Miss: The attack deals no damage, the target moves into the nearest unoccupied space that isn't in the shrike ship's path, and the shrike ship can continue moving if it has any movement left.

### Info

This swift vessel is a relatively recent design, quickly gaining popularity with merchants and pirates. A shrike ship's legs enable it to land safely on the ground. The ship can float but isn't built for traveling on water and sinks quickly in rough seas.
Standard weaponry on a shrike ship includes three ballistae—one on the forecastle, one in the middle of the top deck, and one on the sterncastle. In a desperate situation, the ship's reinforced bow can be used as a piercing ram.

## Scorpion Ship

|                               |                              |

**Cost:** — (included in ship cost)

It takes 1 action to make a Claw attack.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:*  +3 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it is also grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the creature takes 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns.

### Mangonel (Crew: 5)

**Armor Class:** 15

**Hit Points:** 100

**Cost:** 100 gp (mangonel), — (stone)

It takes 2 actions to load the mangonel, 2 actions to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.

***Mangonel Stone.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:*  +5 to hit, range 200/800 ft. (can't hit targets within 60 feet of it), one target. *Hit:* 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage.

### Info

Scorpion ships are archaic metal warships that have never lost their popularity, largely because of their versatility. Articulated legs enable a scorpion ship to land safely on the ground and move across a solid surface at a walking speed of 30 feet. The ship can't float on water, however. A ballista is mounted on the top deck, and a mangonel is perched on the end of the tail. The ship's two claws are relatively inefficient in combat, but a claw that grabs a creature can quickly take it out of action.

## Nightspider

|                             |                               |

### Info

Neogi terrorize Wildspace in ships of their own construction, which others call nightspiders. These vessels often wait in ambush for other ships. Once a target ship is identified, the neogi try to steal its *spelljamming helm* and capture its crew.
A nightspider's crew usually consists of nineteen neogi and up to a half-dozen **umber hulks**, which the neogi use as shock troops.
Nightspiders are designed for space travel alone and can't float on water or land safely on the ground (the weight of the ship would snap its spindly legs, destroying its weblike rigging in the process). Standard weaponry on a nightspider includes four ballistae (two forward-facing and two aft-facing) and a forward-facing mangonel.

## Nautiloid

### Tentacles

**Armor Class:** —

**Hit Points:** —

**Cost:** — (included in ship cost)

As an action, the ship's spelljammer can make one of the following attacks with the ship's tentacles.

***Grappling Tentacles.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:*  +8 to hit, reach 30 ft., one Huge or Gargantuan target. *Hit:* 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage, and the nautiloid's speed becomes 0 until its spelljammer uses an action to release the target. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). If the target is another ship, the target's speed becomes 0 until the nautiloid releases it, or until the target or the nautiloid drops to 0 hit points.

***Teleport.*** *Melee Spell Attack:*  +8 to hit, reach 30 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be teleported to an unoccupied space aboard the nautiloid that the nautiloid's spelljammer can see.

### Info

Built and used by **mind flayers**, nautiloids are designed exclusively for space travel. They can't float on water, nor can they land safely on the ground.
As an action, a creature attuned to a nautiloid's *spelljamming helm* and in physical contact with the ship can transport the nautiloid and all creatures and objects aboard it to a different plane of existence, at or near a destination envisioned by the spelljammer (or to a random location on the plane if no destination is envisioned). This property is a feature of the ship, not the *spelljamming helm*. Each time this property is used, roll a d6. On a 5–6, the property recharges after 1 minute; otherwise, it can't be used again for 24 hours.

## Living Ship

|                            |                                   |

| **Damage Threshold:** 15   | **Keel/Beam:** 80 ft./20 ft.      |

### Ballista (Crew: 3)

**Armor Class:** 15

**Hit Points:** 50

**Cost:** 50 gp (ballista), 5 gp (bolt)

It takes 1 action to load the ballista, 1 action to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.

***Bolt.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:*  +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (3d10) piercing damage.

### Info

Druids, rangers, and clerics devoted to gods of nature are often found aboard living ships, as are Wildspace explorers who don't want to have to worry about their ship's air envelope becoming fouled during a long voyage.
This ship's main distinctive feature is the fully grown **treant** on the aft deck. The treant has a speed of 0 because its roots are woven into the deck; it and the ship are inseparable. If the ship is reduced to 0 hit points, the treant dies of shock. The ship can function if its treant dies, but the treant can never be replaced with another.
When the treant finishes a long rest, it repairs the ship's hull, enabling the ship to regain 4d12 hit points, and refreshes the ship's air envelope (turning deadly air into foul air, or foul air into fresh air).
A living ship can float on water and sail across it, but it can't land safely on the ground (its keel would cause it to roll on its side). Its standard weaponry is an aft-mounted ballista.

## Lamprey Ship

|                            |                               |

### Grappling Jaws (Crew: 1)

**Armor Class:** —

**Hit Points:** —

**Cost:** — (included in ship cost)

It takes 1 action to make a Grappling Jaws attack.

***Grappling Jaws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:*  +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one ship or Gargantuan creature. *Hit:* 22 (4d10) piercing damage, and the speed of the lamprey ship and the target become 0 until the grapple ends. As an action, a creature can use the grappling jaws' controls to release the target. Otherwise, the effect ends when the target or the lamprey ship drops to 0 hit points.

### Info

Lamprey ships are antiquated, being among the oldest spelljamming ships still in use. **Psurlons** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) are particularly fond of them.
Using the metal grappling jaws built into its bow, a lamprey ship can attach itself to another ship, which is a critical feature during boarding actions. Other standard weapons include four ballistae on the main deck.
A lamprey can float on water, though it can't land safely on the ground. Lamprey ships that land on the ground have the distressing habit of rolling over, as more than a few crews have discovered to their dismay.

The hammerhead ship takes half as much damage and comes to a dead stop. *Miss:* The attack deals no damage, the target moves into the nearest unoccupied space that isn't in the hammerhead ship's path, and the hammerhead ship can continue moving if it has any movement left.

### Info

Hammerhead ships are popular craft, especially among pirates and merchants carrying heavy cargo. They can float on water and sail across it, but they aren't built to land on the ground (their keels would cause them to tip to one side). Standard weapons on a hammerhead ship include fore and aft mangonels, a ballista, and a reinforced bow for ramming.

This swift but cramped ship is made mostly of metal. It can't float on water, but its legs enable it to land safely on the ground. A sliding hatch just behind the wings allows access to the ship's mangonel turret. The ship's cargo hold can easily be turned into crew cabins or another weapon deck.
Damselfly ships are often used as courier vessels and armored transports. Explorers and pirates like them because they're fast and sturdy. Military leaders use them as command ships for the same reasons.
Damselfly ship owners are a proud lot, fond of painting their ships in colorful patterns as well as customizing their vessels with special equipment. Large, private gatherings of damselfly ship owners are not uncommon; they use these get-togethers to show off their ships and to race one another through asteroid belts and other obstacle courses, either for rewards or bragging rights.

These cannon balls make up most of the weight of the ship's cargo. A winch mounted on the aft deck is used to load the cannon balls on board.
A bombard can float and sail on water, but it can't land safely on the ground (its keel would cause it to roll on its side).

## Taskmaster's Drums

*Ship Upgrade, Miscellaneous*

This 4-foot-tall bronze drum comes with a pair of iron mallets. A creature can activate the drums as an action, causing the hammers to float above the drum and strike it to produce a thundering rhythm. For the next minute, the ship gains one additional action, as long as it has at least one action. Once this item is used, it can't be activated again for 2d10 hours.

---

## Storm Giant Figurehead

*Ship Upgrade, Figurehead*

This figurehead depicts a storm giant clutching a thunderbolt. As an action, the ship can activate this item to create a 60-foot cone that originates from the figurehead. Each creature in the cone must make DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its saving throw is also pushed 10 feet away from the figurehead. Once a ship uses this action, it can't use it again for 1 minute.

---

## Smuggler's Banner

*Ship Upgrade, Miscellaneous*

This flag is meant to be flown from a ship's mast. Its powerful magic causes it to appear as a flag or banner displaying the symbol of a group, captain, or realm friendly to the viewer. Multiple viewers might see different flags or crests.

The banner's true power is its ability to aid a ship in making rapid escapes. As an action, the ship and all friendly creatures aboard it teleport up to 3 miles to a known destination of the captain's choice. Hostile creatures aboard the ship don't move with the ship and fall into the water it once occupied. Once this item is used to teleport, it can't teleport in this way again for 2d6 days.

---

## Red Dragon Figurehead

*Ship Upgrade, Figurehead*

This figurehead depicts a red dragon rearing to strike, its mouth open. As an action, the ship can activate this item to create a 60-foot cone of flame that originates from the figurehead.

Once a ship uses this action, it can't use it again for 1 minute.

---

## Guardian Figurehead

*Ship Upgrade, Figurehead*

This figurehead depicts an armored knight. As an action, the ship can activate this item, causing it to animate as an **iron golem**. The golem acts on the ship's turn when the captain uses one of the ship's actions. The golem remains animated for 1 minute. At the end of that time, it teleports back to its position as a figurehead. Once a ship uses this action, it can't use it again for 24 hours.

---

## Bones of Endless Toil

*Ship Upgrade, Miscellaneous*

The bones of ancient, mysterious creatures festoon the ship. Potent runes crawl across these remains, emitting a sickly green radiance. When a humanoid dies aboard the ship, that creature must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, it dies as normal. If it fails, it immediately rises as a **zombie** obedient to the ship's captain. The zombie gains a working knowledge of the ship, allowing it to serve as a member of the crew. A number of creatures equal to the ship's creature capacity can be animated in this manner at any given time.

---

## Vigilant Watch

*Ship Upgrade, Hull*

A row of crystal orbs, each filled with viscous liquid and a beholder's eyeball, is mounted along this ship's hull. Invisible creatures are visible while on the ship or within 120 feet of it.

---

## Scything Oars

*Ship Upgrade, Movement*

Sharpened, magically reinforced oars make a vessel dangerous to approach. When the ship takes an action that moves it with these oars, any creature or object in the water within 10 feet of it at any point of the move must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 slashing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

---

## Screaming Sails

*Ship Upgrade, Movement*

Woven from the energy of captured wraiths and bound with the spirit of a banshee, these sails groan mournfully when they catch the wind. As an action, while within 5 feet of the sails, the ship's captain can cause the sails to unleash a howl. Every creature hostile to the ship who is on board or within 300 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, or the creature takes 4d6 psychic damage and is then frightened for 1 minute. Once this ability has been used, it can't be used again until 2d6 hours have passed.

---

## Reinforced Hull

*Ship Upgrade, Hull*

A master shipwright can use superior materials and clever design to make a ship's hull more resilient. Such reinforcement doubles the hull's hit point maximum.

---

## Grasping Rounds

*Ship Upgrade, Weapon*

This weapon creates spectral chains that trail after its shots, restraining enemy vessels in their grasp. When this weapon hits a ship, that vehicle must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or it can't move away from the attacker. As an action, the attacking ship can end this effect, and the target can end it by taking an action and succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check.

---

## Explosive Rounds

*Ship Upgrade, Weapon*

Drawing on powerful evocation magic, this weapon's attacks are imbued with unstable energy that explodes in a fiery blast. When this weapon hits, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage.

---

## Dragon Sails

---

## Defiant Sails

*Ship Upgrade, Movement*

These sails glitter with a fine coat of mithral treated with abjuration magic. While the sails are unfurled, ranged weapon attacks made against the ship and anyone aboard it are made with disadvantage, as a result of the sails' protective magic. This drawback doesn't apply if the attacker is aboard the ship.

---

## Concussive Rounds

*Ship Upgrade, Weapon*

Enhanced by abjuration magic, this weapon's attacks burst with raucous noise capable of momentarily distracting and disorienting enemy crews. If this weapon hits a vehicle's hull, that vehicle's speed decreases by 2d10 feet until the start of the attacker's next turn.

---

## Living Vessel

*Ship Upgrade, Hull*

This vessel's hull was crafted in the Feywild under the direction of master eladrin shipwrights. It is a living plant, drawing sustenance from water and sunlight. Vines covered in thick leaves hang over its side, and the wood runs with fresh sap when damaged. The ship gains a +2 bonus to all Constitution checks or saving throws. As long as the ship has at least 1 hit point, it regains 10 hit points every minute.

---

## Frost-Locked Hull

*Ship Upgrade, Hull*

This upgrade replaces a ship's hull with supernatural ice drawn from the elemental planes. The hull and the other components of the ship are immune to cold damage but vulnerable to fire damage. The ship can also move at its normal speed over ice of any thickness, floating on the ice at the same depth as it would in water.

---

## Death Vessel

*Ship Upgrade, Hull*

Crafted with materials harvested from the Shadowfell, this upgrade grants a ship an aura of dread. As an action, the ship can create a pulse of horrific energy. Every creature that is an enemy of the ship who is on board or within 210 feet of it must make DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is frightened of the ship for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. Once this ability is used, it can't be used again until 1d4 hours have passed.

---

## Churning Hull

*Ship Upgrade, Hull*

A tempest rages within these rune-etched, iron chains. Raiders and pirates who operate under the blessings of a storm god sometimes make use of this upgrade.

By draping the chains over a ship's hull, the storm's fury thrashes into the water around it. The water within 210 feet of the ship is difficult terrain for everything other than this ship.
