#### Feature: All Eyes on You

Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.

You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.

|  1  | I have different assumptions from those around me concerning personal space, blithely invading others' space in innocence, or reacting to ignorant invasion of my own. |
|  2  | I have my own ideas about what is and is not food, and I find the eating habits of those around me fascinating, confusing, or revolting.                               |
|  3  | I have a strong code of honor or sense of propriety that others don't comprehend.                                                                                      |
|  4  | I express affection or contempt in ways that are unfamiliar to others.                                                                                                 |
|  5  | I honor my deities through practices that are foreign to this land.                                                                                                    |
|  6  | I begin or end my day with small traditional rituals that are unfamiliar to those around me.                                                                           |

|  3  | Adventure. I'm far from home, and everything is strange and wonderful! (Chaotic)                           |

|  2  | The gods of my people are a comfort to me so far away from home.                                           |

|  3  | I have a weakness for the new intoxicants and other pleasures of this land.                                                       |
|  4  | I don't take kindly to some of the actions and motivations of the people of this land, because these folks are different from me. |

|  6  | I have a weakness for the exotic beauty of the people of these lands.                                                             |
