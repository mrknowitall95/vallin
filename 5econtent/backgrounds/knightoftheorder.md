## Knight of the Order

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate for your order
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Your choice of a gaming set or a musical instrument
- **Languages:** Any one of your choice
- **Equipment:** One set of *traveler's clothes*, a signet, banner, or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Knightly Regard

You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the communityâ€”whether a lone settlement or a great nationâ€”that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share their ideals.

This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a knight of your order.

Your bond almost always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a knight's ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one's order.
