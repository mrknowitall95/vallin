## Defiant Sails

*Ship Upgrade, Movement*

These sails glitter with a fine coat of mithral treated with abjuration magic. While the sails are unfurled, ranged weapon attacks made against the ship and anyone aboard it are made with disadvantage, as a result of the sails' protective magic. This drawback doesn't apply if the attacker is aboard the ship.
