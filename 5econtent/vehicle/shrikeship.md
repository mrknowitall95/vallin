### 3 Ballistae (Crew: 3 each)

**Armor Class:** 15

**Hit Points:** 50

**Cost:** 50 gp (ballista), 5 gp (bolt)

It takes 1 action to load a ballista, 1 action to aim it, and 1 action to fire it.

***Bolt.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:*  +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (3d10) piercing damage.

### Piercing Ram

**Armor Class:** —

**Hit Points:** —

**Cost:** — (included in ship cost)

The ship's spelljammer can make the following attack when the ship runs into another object or into a Gargantuan creature (see "*Crashing*" earlier in the chapter).

***Piercing Ram.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:*  +8 to hit, range 0 ft., one object or Gargantuan creature. *Hit:* 88 (16d10) piercing damage. The shrike ship takes half as much damage and comes to a dead stop. Miss: The attack deals no damage, the target moves into the nearest unoccupied space that isn't in the shrike ship's path, and the shrike ship can continue moving if it has any movement left.

### Info

This swift vessel is a relatively recent design, quickly gaining popularity with merchants and pirates. A shrike ship's legs enable it to land safely on the ground. The ship can float but isn't built for traveling on water and sinks quickly in rough seas.
Standard weaponry on a shrike ship includes three ballistae—one on the forecastle, one in the middle of the top deck, and one on the sterncastle. In a desperate situation, the ship's reinforced bow can be used as a piercing ram.
