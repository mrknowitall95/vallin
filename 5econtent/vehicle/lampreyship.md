### Info

Lamprey ships are antiquated, being among the oldest spelljamming ships still in use. **Psurlons** (see *Boo's Astral Menagerie*) are particularly fond of them.
Using the metal grappling jaws built into its bow, a lamprey ship can attach itself to another ship, which is a critical feature during boarding actions. Other standard weapons include four ballistae on the main deck.
A lamprey can float on water, though it can't land safely on the ground. Lamprey ships that land on the ground have the distressing habit of rolling over, as more than a few crews have discovered to their dismay.
