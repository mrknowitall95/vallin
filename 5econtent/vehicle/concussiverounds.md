## Concussive Rounds

*Ship Upgrade, Weapon*

Enhanced by abjuration magic, this weapon's attacks burst with raucous noise capable of momentarily distracting and disorienting enemy crews. If this weapon hits a vehicle's hull, that vehicle's speed decreases by 2d10 feet until the start of the attacker's next turn.
