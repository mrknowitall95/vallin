## Guardian Figurehead

*Ship Upgrade, Figurehead*

This figurehead depicts an armored knight. As an action, the ship can activate this item, causing it to animate as an **iron golem**. The golem acts on the ship's turn when the captain uses one of the ship's actions. The golem remains animated for 1 minute. At the end of that time, it teleports back to its position as a figurehead. Once a ship uses this action, it can't use it again for 24 hours.
