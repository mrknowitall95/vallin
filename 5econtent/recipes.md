## Bangers and Smash

**Serves** 4

1½ pounds (about 16) small red-skinned or Yukon gold creamer potatoes, scrubbed

½ cup extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 leeks, white and light green parts, halved lengthwise and cut into 1-inch pieces

4 to 8 fresh or fully cooked chicken or pork sausages (breakfast sausages or any flavor of your choice)

1 pound large cherry tomatoes

2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Preheat the oven to 450°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.

On a large rimmed baking sheet, roast the potatoes until very tender, about 40 minutes.

Remove the baking sheet from the oven (leave the oven on) and set aside to cool, about 10 minutes. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl, brush the baking sheet with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and sprinkle the sheet lightly with salt and pepper. Return the potatoes to the baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. With the bottom of a mug or another baking sheet (to do all the potatoes at once), sharply press down on the potatoes to break their skins and compress the flesh to a thickness of about 1 inch (do not smash them thinner). Brush the potatoes with 2 tablespoons olive oil, return them to the oven, and continue to roast for 15 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, turn the potatoes over, and rearrange them over about half the baking sheet.

In the now-empty bowl, toss the leeks with 3 tablespoons olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and spread them on the empty side of the baking sheet. Add the sausages to the now-empty bowl, add 1½ teaspoons olive oil, and toss to coat. Arrange the sausages over the leeks.

Roast for 8 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, move the sausages to the side, stir the leeks, spread them over about two-thirds of the empty space on the baking sheet, and replace the sausages over the leeks.

In the now-empty bowl, toss the tomatoes with the remaining 1½ teaspoons oil to coat. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and toss again. Spread the tomatoes in the empty space on the baking sheet and continue to roast until the skins burst, the sausages are warmed through, and the potatoes are crisp, about 10 minutes more.

Transfer the potatoes, tomatoes, sausages, and leeks to a serving platter, sprinkle with the parsley, and serve.

## Black Pudding

**Serves** 4

⅔ cup packed light brown sugar

¼ cup instant espresso powder

3 tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa powder

3 tablespoons cornstarch

½ teaspoon kosher salt

3 egg yolks

¾ cup heavy cream

2¾ cups whole milk

¼ cup unsalted butter

1½ teaspoons pure vanilla extract

1 tablespoon coffee liqueur, such as Kahlua

2 teaspoons brandy or cognac

Chocolate shavings for serving

Very lightly sweetened whipped cream for serving (optional)

Avoid substituting the Dutch-processed cocoa powder here, because it's darker than natural cocoa and has a distinct flavor. You will be able to taste the cocoa in the pudding, but the espresso will be the dominant flavor.

In a heavy saucepan, whisk together the brown sugar, espresso powder, cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt, breaking up any brown sugar lumps as you go. Add the egg yolks and cream and whisk, reaching into the corners of the pan, until the mixture is smooth and uniform. Add the milk and whisk until incorporated.

Set the pan over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly and reaching into the corners of the pan, until the mixture is thickened and bubbling across its surface, 8 to 10 minutes. Continue cooking for about 1 minute more. Remove from the heat; add the butter, vanilla, coffee liqueur, and brandy; and whisk to melt and incorporate the butter fully.

Set a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl. Pour in the pudding and, with a flexible spatula, fold and stir the pudding gently to work it through the strainer. With a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap, cover the pudding, pressing the paper or wrap directly onto the pudding surface.

Refrigerate until cold and set, at least 4 or up to 12 hours. At serving time, stir the pudding gently until smooth and then top with chocolate shavings and whipped cream, if using.

## Corned Beef and Cabbage

**Serves** 4

4 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled

3 tablespoons store-bought mixed pickling spice

1 (3-pound) corned beef brisket, flat (or thin) cut, rinsed well and fat trimmed to about a ¼-inch-thick layer, if necessary

1 yellow onion, quartered

2 carrots, peeled and chopped

2 celery ribs, trimmed and chopped

2 cups low-sodium chicken broth

1½ pounds (about 16) small red-skinned or Yukon gold creamer potatoes, scrubbed

1 (2-pound) small head green cabbage, tough outer leaves removed, cut through the core into 6 wedges

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened and cut into small pieces

3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

White wine vinegar for serving (optional)

When shopping for corned beef (or brisket, from which corned beef is made), you'll commonly see two cuts—flat (sometimes called thin) and point. Flat-cut is more uniformly shaped and thus will cook more evenly.

Preheat the oven to 300°F with a rack in the middle position of the oven.

In a large Dutch oven, combine the garlic, pickling spice, corned beef, onion, carrots, and celery. Add the broth and enough water to just cover the meat and cook, covered, until the corned beef is super-tender (a paring knife should slip easily into the meat), about 4 hours. Transfer the meat to a baking dish; trim and discard the fat, if desired. Strain and reserve the cooking liquid, and discard the solids. Pour about 1 cup of the liquid over the meat, cover the dish tightly with foil, and let rest for about 30 minutes.

Pour the strained cooking liquid into a fat separator or measuring cup and rest until the fat rises to the surface, about 10 minutes. If you are using a fat separator, pour the liquid into another container; if you are using a measuring cup, tilt it and use a wide, shallow soup spoon to skim any fat off the surface and discard it.

Return the liquid to the Dutch oven, add the potatoes, set the pot over medium-high heat, and bring to a simmer. Adjust the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes just begin to soften, about 8 minutes. Add the cabbage, submerge it in the liquid as best you can (arrange the potatoes among the cabbage wedges), replace the cover, adjust the heat to medium-high, and return to a simmer. Adjust the heat to medium-low and simmer until the potatoes and cabbage are both tender, 10 to 14 minutes more, turning over the cabbage wedges after 6 minutes.

Meanwhile, place the meat on a cutting board, slice it against the grain into thin slices, and set the slices on a large serving platter. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables to a large bowl and sprinkle them with salt, if necessary, and pepper to taste. Scatter the butter pieces over the vegetables, wait a moment for the butter to begin to melt, and gently turn over the vegetables to distribute the butter. Arrange the potatoes and cabbage around the meat on the platter, sprinkle the parsley over the meat and vegetables, and serve with vinegar on the side, if desired.

## Delzoun Tide-Me-Overs

**Serves** 4

¼ cup heavy cream

1 egg

2 slices dark bread (such as rye), crusts discarded, remainder torn into pieces

3 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 small yellow onion, finely chopped

Kosher salt

¼ teaspoon ground allspice

8 ounces ground pork

8 ounces lean ground beef

1 teaspoon baking powder

Freshly ground black pepper

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1⅓ cups low-sodium chicken broth

1 teaspoon light brown sugar

1½ teaspoons soy sauce

½ teaspoon fresh lemon juice

3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh dill or parsley

The sauce will thicken quickly as it cools. You can loosen the consistency by whisking in extra chicken broth or water, about 1 tablespoon at a time, until you have achieved the desired texture.

In a large bowl, whisk together the cream and egg. Add the bread, mix well, and set aside, stirring occasionally, until the bread is softened, about 20 minutes. Using a fork or a sturdy spoon, mash the bread to a paste and set aside.

Meanwhile, in a skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter. Add the onion and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the allspice and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Remove from the heat and let cool to room temperature.

Preheat the oven to 475°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Coat a large wire rack with nonstick cooking spray and set it in a large rimmed baking sheet.

Add the cooled onion mixture, pork, ground beef, baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper to the bread paste and, using a large spoon or your hands, mix until well combined and uniform.

With moistened hands, form the mixture into generous 1-tablespoon-size balls. Arrange the meatballs on the rack in the baking sheet and bake until lightly browned, about 20 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through.

Wipe out the skillet used for the onions to remove any stray onion bits, set it over medium heat, and melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Stirring constantly, cook until fragrant and a shade darker, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Switch to a whisk and, whisking constantly, gradually add the broth. Continuing to whisk often, cook for about 2 minutes. Add the brown sugar, soy sauce, lemon juice, and ¼ teaspoon pepper and continue to whisk and cook until thickened, about 2 minutes more.

Add the meatballs to the sauce and simmer, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 4 minutes. Stir in most of the dill and taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Transfer to a serving dish, sprinkle with the remaining dill, and serve hot.

## Dwarven Flatbread

**Serves** 4

1½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting

1½ teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon baking soda

1½ teaspoons kosher salt

2½ teaspoons dried herb blend (such as Italian seasoning, herbes de Provence, or za'atar), crushed

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

⅔ cup plain low-fat Greek yogurt or whole milk

¼ cup neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

Skillet breads are a great canvas for customizing with simple toppings, such as finely chopped roasted red pepper or caramelized onions, or a schmear of ricotta cheese, added just before serving.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and herb blend to combine. Make a well in the center, add the olive oil and yogurt. With a wooden spoon or your hands, stir around the perimeter of the well to incorporate the wet and dry ingredients; the mixture will look a little rough and shaggy.

Lightly flour a work surface, scoop the dough onto it, and knead until the dough is smooth and uniform, adding a tiny amount of flour as you go if the dough becomes too sticky. Divide the dough into eight equal portions, gently roll each portion into a ball, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let rest for 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 200°F (or the lowest temperature possible) with a rack in the middle of the oven.

With a rolling pin, roll one of the dough balls into a circle about 7 inches in diameter and ¼ inch thick. In a 10-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium heat, warm 1½ teaspoons of the vegetable oil until shimmering. Tilt the skillet to coat the entire cooking surface with oil, carefully place the dough circle in the skillet, and cook, undisturbed, until spotty brown on the bottom and slightly puffed, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the bread over and continue to cook, undisturbed, until the second side is spotty brown as well, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer the bread to a baking sheet or ovenproof plate and place it in the oven to stay warm. Working with one dough ball and 1½ teaspoons oil at a time, repeat to roll, cook, and keep the remaining rounds warm. Note that as the pan accumulates and retains heat from previous batches, the cooking time may decrease by up to a minute. Serve warm and fresh

## Gully Dwarf Homestyle Porridge

**Serves** 4

1½ tablespoons unsalted butter

1 cup steel-cut oats

3¼ cups water

½ cup low-fat or whole milk

¼ teaspoon kosher salt

3 tablespoons light brown sugar, plus 4 teaspoons for garnish

2 tablespoons heavy cream or half-and-half for garnish

Cooking oats in a mixture of water and milk provides a good balance of richness (using all milk can make the porridge overly rich, especially once the cream garnish is added).

Add the water to the toasted oats before the milk, otherwise it might foam up.

The oatmeal will continue to thicken as it cools, so make sure to serve it hot.

In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the oats and cook, stirring constantly, until they smell fragrant, nutty, and toasty and look a shade darker, about 4 minutes.

Add the water, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly. Add the milk, adjust the heat to medium-low and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is thickened to the consistency of applesauce and the oats are tender but chewy, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the salt and 3 tablespoons brown sugar and stir to incorporate.

Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and let rest for about 5 minutes; the oatmeal will thicken to about the consistency of pudding. Serve at once, topping each serving evenly with about 1½ teaspoons cream and 1 teaspoon brown sugar.

## Miner's Pie

**Serves** 4 to 6

#### Filling

1½ tablespoons olive oil

1 yellow onion, chopped

1 large leek, white and light green parts, halved lengthwise and cut into ¾-inch pieces

1 bay leaf

Kosher salt

2 pounds ground beef

3 garlic cloves, finely chopped

2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme

4 tablespoons tomato paste

3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

½ cup ale, such as IPA

1 cup low-sodium chicken broth

¾ cup frozen corn, thawed

¾ cup frozen peas, thawed

¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

Freshly ground black pepper

#### Topping

3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled, cut into 1-inch chunks, and rinsed well

3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

⅔ cup whole milk or half-and-half

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

2 eggs, beaten

¾ cup coarsely grated Monterey Jack or Colby cheese

***Make the Filling.*** In a very large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onion, leek, bay leaf, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the ground beef and cook, stirring and breaking up any clumps, until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme, and tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Adjust the heat to medium, add the flour, and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes, until the flour is completely blended in. Add the ale, broth, and ¾ teaspoon salt. Adjust the heat to high and bring to a simmer, using a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the skillet to loosen and dissolve any browned bits stuck to the pan, about 1 minute. Adjust the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the skillet occasionally, until the filling is thickened but still saucy, about 15 minutes.

Add the corn and peas and set the skillet aside, off the heat to cool slightly. Remove the bay leaf, add most of the parsley, and stir to mix. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, if necessary, and pepper to taste. Scrape the mixture into a broiler-safe 2-quart casserole dish, spread evenly, and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 450°F with a rack in the upper-middle of the oven.

***Meanwhile, Make the Topping.*** Put the potatoes in a steaming basket. Fill a Dutch oven or large saucepan with enough water to just reach the bottom of the steaming basket and bring to a boil over high heat. Set the steamer basket in the pot, cover, adjust the heat to medium-high, and cook until the potatoes are very tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the steamer basket and pour the water out of the pot.

Set a potato ricer over the pot and rice the potatoes into it. Add the melted butter and stir it into the potatoes. Add the milk, 1½ teaspoons salt, pepper to taste, and the Parmesan and stir to incorporate. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary, and set aside to cool for about 20 minutes.

Add the eggs to the potatoes and stir to incorporate. Spoon the potatoes over the filling, spreading them evenly and making sure they reach to the edges of the casserole dish. Sprinkle evenly with the Monterey Jack. Place the dish on a large baking sheet and bake until the filling is heated through and the potatoes are puffed slightly, about 20 minutes.

Turn on the broiler and cook until the top is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley and serve hot.

## Orange Mountain Duck

**Serves** 4

3 or 4 oranges, preferably navels

4 boneless duck breast halves (about 8 ounces each)

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 shallot, minced

1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme

½ cup low-sodium chicken broth

1½ tablespoons honey

1½ tablespoons brandy or cognac

Pinch of cayenne

1 tablespoon unsalted butter

2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

1 firm-ripe Fuyu persimmon, peeled and diced into neat ¼-inch pieces (optional)

Finely grate 2 teaspoons zest from one of the oranges and set aside. Cut the peel and pith off the zested and a second orange. Working over a strainer set in a bowl, separate the orange segments. Discard any seeds and reserve the segments. Shake the strainer so all the juice drips into the bowl; pour the juice into a measuring cup. If necessary, squeeze one or both of the remaining oranges for enough juice to equal ⅔ cup and then set aside.

Preheat the oven to 200°F with the rack in the middle of the oven. With a sharp paring knife, cut four or five diagonal slashes in the skin on each duck breast half, taking care to cut down to, but not into, the flesh. Dry the halves well and sprinkle all over with salt and pepper.

Place the duck breasts skin-side down in a large nonstick skillet, set the skillet over medium heat, and cook, undisturbed, until most of the fat is rendered (if necessary, pour or spoon the fat out of the skillet occasionally) and the skin is deeply browned and crisp, 12 to 14 minutes, adjusting the heat, if necessary, to prevent scorching. Turn the halves skin-side up and continue cooking, undisturbed, until an instant-read thermometer in the thickest part registers about 125°F for medium-rare or 130° to 135°F for medium, 2 to 8 minutes more. Transfer the duck to a heatproof plate, tent loosely with foil, and place it in the oven to rest and keep warm, about 5 minutes.

Pour or spoon off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat from the skillet. Return the skillet to medium-low heat, add the shallot, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 1 minute. Add the orange juice, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the consistency is slightly syrupy and the juice is reduced by half, about 4 minutes.

Add the broth and any accumulated duck juices to the skillet, return to a simmer, and simmer vigorously, stirring occasionally, until the consistency is slightly syrupy and the volume is reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes more. Adjust the heat to medium-low and add the honey, brandy, cayenne, and reserved orange zest. Simmer, stirring, to melt and incorporate the honey and brandy, about 1 minute more. Add the butter and stir constantly while it melts and incorporates into the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Add most of the parsley and stir to incorporate. Pour or spoon about half of the sauce onto a warm serving plate.

Meanwhile, diagonally cut each duck breast half into ½-inch slices. Fan the slices over the sauce, top with the reserved orange segments, persimmon (if using), and the remaining sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley and serve hot.

## Plate-of-Gold

**Serves** 4 as an appetizer

#### Sweet and Sour Sauce

⅓ cup apricot or peach jam or orange marmalade

⅓ cup ketchup

3 tablespoons cider vinegar

1 tablespoon light or dark brown sugar

2 teaspoons soy sauce

½ teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (optional)

Kosher salt

#### Tempura

About 1½ quarts canola or other high-smoke-point oil for frying

⅔ cup cake flour

3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Kosher salt

⅔ cup plus 1 tablespoon sparkling water, cold

8 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed, very large caps halved, cold

1 sweet potato, peeled, halved lengthwise, and cut crosswise into ¼-inch slices, cold

1 yellow onion, trimmed, halved pole to pole, and cut lengthwise into ½-inch slivers, cold

MAKE THE SAUCE. In a small saucepan over medium heat, warm the jam, stirring, until mostly fluid, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, chile-garlic sauce (if using), and ½ teaspoon salt and whisk to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking, to blend the flavors, about 1 minute. Set aside to cool to room temperature. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, if necessary.

MAKE THE TEMPURA. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels and set aside. Clip a deep-fry or candy thermometer to the side of a heavy 5-quart Dutch oven, add the oil, and warm over medium-high heat to 390°F. Preheat the oven to 200°F. Place a wire rack on a second large, rimmed baking sheet and set aside.

Meanwhile, fill a large bowl about one-third full with ice and about 1½ cups water. In a medium (preferably stainless-steel) bowl that will fit in the larger bowl, whisk together the cake and all-purpose flours and ¾ teaspoon salt; set this bowl in the bowl with the ice water to chill the flour mixture. When the oil reaches 390°F, add the sparkling water to the flour mixture and stir just until the wet and dry are incorporated, but still a little lumpy; do not overmix.

Working with about eight pieces at a time, use tongs or chopsticks to dip them in the batter to coat thoroughly. Allow any excess batter to drip off, then slip them into the oil and fry until slightly puffed and pale gold, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain 390°F, stirring to prevent sticking, and turning the pieces over in the oil once or twice to promote even frying, 5 to 6 minutes for each batch. With a spider skimmer, slotted spoon, or long tongs, transfer the tempura to the paper towel–lined baking sheet to drain for about 30 seconds. Sprinkle lightly with salt and place on the wire rack set on the baking sheet and put in the oven to keep warm. Allow the oil to recover to 390°F and fry the remaining batches. Serve with the sweet and sour sauce.

## Potato Leek Soup

**Serves** 6

2 slices thick-cut bacon

3 leeks, white and light green parts, thinly sliced

3 celery stalks, chopped

2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves

2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces

4 cups low-sodium chicken broth

Kosher salt

1 cup heavy cream

Freshly ground black pepper

In a large heavy pot over medium heat, fry the bacon, turning it over as necessary, until well-rendered and lightly browned, about 13 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to transfer the bacon to a paper towel.

Add the leeks, celery, and thyme to the pot and cook, stirring, until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Add the potatoes, broth, and 1 teaspoon salt. Simmer until the potatoes are soft, 15 to 20 minutes.

Remove the soup from the heat. Using an immersion blender, blend until smooth. Alternatively, blend the soup in batches using a countertop blender.

Return the soup to the pot over medium heat. Stir in the cream and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Taste and season with black pepper and more salt, if needed. Crumble the cooked bacon. Serve each bowl of soup piping hot and topped with bacon (alternatively, the soup can be served cold).

## Underdark Lotus with Fire Lichen Spread

**Serves** 6

1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed

1 pound carrots (about 4 large), peeled and chopped

¾ teaspoon cumin seeds or sweet paprika

1 teaspoon cayenne

3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

⅔ cup cold water, plus more as needed

¼ cup fresh lemon juice

¼ cup tahini

Radishes, sliced cucumbers, or romaine lettuce leaves for dipping

To create the lotus shape, arrange the vegetables around the bowl of spread as if they were the petals of a flower.

You can use your favorite kind of vegetable for dipping.

Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.

On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss together the chickpeas, carrots, cumin, cayenne, and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Sprinkle with ½ teaspoon salt and lots of pepper. Roast until the carrots are tender, about 25 minutes.

Transfer the roasted carrots and chickpeas to a food processor or blender. Add the water, lemon juice, tahini, and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Blend until completely smooth, adding more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed to make the spread smooth and creamy.

Spoon the spread into a serving bowl, set the bowl on a large plate, and drizzle with olive oil. Arrange the radishes, sliced cucumbers, or romaine around the bowl, ready for dipping, and serve immediately.

## Chultan Zombie

**Serves** 2

Roughly cracked or small ice cubes

5 ounces amber or dark rum

4 ounces fresh pineapple juice

2 ounces fresh orange juice

1½ ounces grenadine

1 ounce fresh lime juice

½ ounce Cointreau or Grand Marnier

4 dashes Angostura bitters

3 ounces seltzer, cold (optional)

2 orange slices, pineapple chunks, and/or maraschino cherries for garnish

If you don't have any Cointreau to add sweetness and flavor, you can substitute 1½ teaspoons superfine sugar to each drink. To make superfine sugar, simply spin regular granulated sugar in the blender or food processor to break down the crystal size, which will allow it to dissolve in liquid more readily.

This is a high-volume drink, and cocktail shakers vary in size; so you may have to prepare the cocktails one at a time. Boston shakers, the type used in most bars, are larger than cobbler shakers with built-in strainers, which are common for home use.

Fill a cocktail shaker about halfway with ice and add the rum, pineapple juice, orange juice, grenadine, lime juice, Cointreau, and bitters. Cover and shake to blend and chill, 30 seconds. Fill two chilled Collins or highball glasses about halfway with ice. Strain half the mixture into each. If using, add 1½ ounces seltzer to each glass and stir gently. Garnish each cocktail as desired and serve at once.

## Cocoa Broth

**Serves** 4

½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder, preferably Dutch-processed

½ cup packed light brown sugar, or to taste

¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon

½ teaspoon ground cardamom

Pinch of kosher salt

1 cup water

2½ cups whole milk

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

1½ cups espresso or very strong black coffee, hot

Marshmallows, for serving (optional)

In a saucepan over medium heat, whisk together the cocoa powder, brown sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, salt, and water until smooth. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook, whisking constantly, for about 2 minutes, making sure the whisk gets into the edges of the pan. Whisk in the milk and bring to a simmer (do not boil), whisking frequently, about 10 minutes. Whisk in the vanilla and espresso. Taste and adjust the flavor with additional brown sugar, if desired. Divide among four mugs, add the marshmallow (if using), and serve.

## Delayed Blast Fireball

**Makes** about 1¾ cups

**Serves** 1 to 2

1½ cups bourbon

½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste

5 cinnamon sticks, broken in half

¼ cup packed light brown sugar

⅓ cup hot water

The ½ teaspoon of crushed red pepper will provide a noticeable, moderate heat. If you prefer a more intense heat, use up to 1 teaspoon. You can give the drink more flavor nuance by replacing the crushed red pepper flakes with toasted chile. Toast half of a small dried California, pasilla, or guajillo chile in a dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes. Cool the chile and tear into very small (½-inch) pieces. For extra heat, use some of the chile seeds as well.

This drink can be enjoyed neat, over ice, mixed with cola, or as the foundation of an excellent hot toddy with spiced chai.

In a clean glass jar with a lid, combine the bourbon, red pepper flakes, and cinnamon sticks. Screw on the lid, shake, and store in a cool, dark place to infuse for 5 days, shaking the jar at least once a day.

In a bowl, whisk the brown sugar and hot water to dissolve the sugar fully and set aside to cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes. Line a fine-mesh strainer with cheesecloth, set it over the bowl with the brown sugar mixture, and strain the bourbon into it.

Wash and dry the jar and return the firestar wine to it. Serve or store in a cool, dark place for up to 3 months.

## Dwarven Mulled Wine

**Serves** 4

2 juice oranges, such as Valencia

8 whole cloves

⅓ cup packed light brown sugar, or to taste

1 (750-ml) bottle medium-bodied, fruity red wine, such as Merlot or Syrah

1 cinnamon stick

⅛ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

3 tablespoons brandy, or to taste

The flavor of mulled wine improves with rest, so consider starting it several hours ahead of time. Reheat it gently, careful to avoid boiling (which can cause an oxidized taste), then remove the aromatics and add the vanilla and brandy.

Mulled wine recipes vary widely. This one is heavy on the orange, light on the spice and sweetener, and includes brandy for a modest potency boost. However, it can be customized with different liqueurs such as Grand Marnier, Cointreau, or St-Germain, and spices such as cardamom pods, black peppercorns, or whole allspice.

Using a vegetable peeler, remove the zest from the oranges in wide strips; reserve one strip for each drink and refrigerate, covered, until serving time. Stick the cloves into two or three of the remaining zest strips and set aside. Cut the zested oranges in half and juice them (which should yield about ¾ cup juice).

In a large saucepan over medium heat, bring the orange juice and brown sugar to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the wine, cinnamon stick, and orange zest (including the clove-studded pieces) and bring to a simmer. Adjust the heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered and stirring occasionally, until the wine is fragrant and infused, about 1 hour (do not allow it to boil). Add the vanilla and brandy and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, to blend the flavors, about 2 minutes more. Taste and adjust the flavor with additional brown sugar and/or brandy, if necessary. With a slotted spoon, remove and discard the cinnamon stick, orange zest, and cloves.

Meanwhile, fill one small mug or heatproof glass for each drinker with hot water to preheat them, about 2 minutes. Empty the mugs or glasses, ladle some of the wine into each, garnish with one of the reserved orange zest strips, and serve at once.

## Evermead

**Serves** 4

2 cinnamon sticks, broken in half

8 whole cloves

4 cups water

1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled, cut into 3 or 4 slices, and smashed

¼ cup honey

6 tablespoons seedless blackberry or boysenberry jam

Kosher salt

If you prefer the alcoholic version of Evermead, add about 1½ ounces of vodka or brandy per serving, garnish with a twist of orange.

In a saucepan over medium heat, warm the cinnamon sticks and cloves until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Carefully add the water (it may sputter) and ginger, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Add the honey, jam, and a tiny pinch of salt and return to a simmer, whisking to dissolve the honey and jam. Adjust the heat to low, partially cover the pot, and simmer to blend the flavors, about 20 minutes. Cover the pot completely, remove it from the heat, and let steep for 20 minutes more. Strain the mixture into a bowl or other container. Serve warm, at room temperature, or lightly chilled.

## Goodberry Blend

**Serves** 4

½ cup ice cubes

1½ cups orange juice

1 cup packed baby spinach

3 tablespoons honey

Pinch of kosher salt

2 cups frozen blueberries, partially thawed

1 sliced banana, frozen

For a more robust flavor, consider adding 1–2 tablespoons of fresh ginger to the blend.

Put the ice in a blender and pulse to crush. Add the orange juice, spinach, honey, and salt; pulse to begin breaking up the greens. Blend to liquefy the solids, 20 to 60 seconds, depending on your blender. Add the blueberries and banana and blend until the mixture is uniform, thick, and moves easily in the blender jar, about 45 seconds. Pour into four cups and serve immediately.

## Hot Spiced Cider

**Serves** 4

1 large orange

8 whole cloves

1 teaspoon whole allspice berries, coarsely crushed

2 cinnamon sticks

3 cups apple cider or unfiltered apple juice

2 cups pure cranberry juice

3 tablespoons light brown sugar, or as needed

Pinch of kosher salt

¼ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Fresh cranberries for garnish (optional)

Using a vegetable peeler, remove the zest from the orange in wide strips; reserve one strip for each drink and refrigerate, covered, until serving time. Stick the cloves into two or three of the remaining zest strips and set aside. (Reserve the orange for another use.)

In a large saucepan over medium heat, warm the allspice and cinnamon sticks, stirring, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and carefully add the cider (it will sputter vigorously), cranberry juice, brown sugar, and the clove-studded orange zest strips. Adjust the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the brown sugar. Adjust the heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered and stirring occasionally, to infuse the cider mixture, about 20 minutes. Cover the pot completely, remove from the heat, and let steep for 20 minutes more.

Set a fine-mesh strainer over a large heatproof bowl. Pour in the cider, discard the solids, and return the mixture to the saucepan. Over medium heat, return the cider to a simmer. Add the vanilla, stir, taste, and adjust the seasoning with additional brown sugar, if necessary.

Meanwhile, fill one small mug or heatproof glass for each drinker with hot water to preheat them, about 2 minutes. Empty the mugs or glasses, ladle some of the cider into each, garnish with one of the reserved orange zest strips and a couple of cranberries (if using), and serve at once.

## Mushroom Tea

**Serves** 4

2 (5- to 6-inch long by 3-inch wide) strips kombu (dried kelp), lightly wiped with a damp cloth

4½ cups water

2 ounces (about 5) fresh shiitake mushrooms, stems removed and caps very thinly sliced

1 tablespoon soy sauce

¾ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste

2 tablespoons sake

2 scallions, white and light green parts, thinly sliced, for garnish

Sometimes packages of kombu are labeled "Dashi Kombu" (dashi being the traditional Japanese broth of which kombu is a main component).

Serve this savory tea in mugs, for sipping, along with spoons for eating the mushrooms and scallions.

In a saucepan, submerge the kombu in the water and let rest until softened, about 30 minutes. Set the pan over medium heat and bring the water to a simmer, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the kombu and discard. Adjust the heat to medium-high and bring the liquid to a boil, about 3 minutes. Stir in the shiitakes, soy sauce, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shiitakes are tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the sake. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, if necessary. Serve, sprinkling a portion of the scallions over each serving.

## Par-Salian's Tea

**Serves** 4

1 lemon

2½-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled if desired

5 cups boiling water

Honey as needed

4 sprigs fresh mint

Peeling the ginger isn't strictly necessary.

The ginger and lemon zest will continue to infuse the liquid as you drink. For the strongest flavor, leave them in the mug until you finish; remove them at any point when you find the flavor sufficiently potent.

Using a vegetable peeler and working vertically, remove the zest from the lemon in wide strips (it should produce eight strips). Slice the ginger into four pieces, each about ½ inch thick, and working with one slice at a time, use the bottom of a sturdy mug or the flat side of a chef's knife to smash them. Place two lemon zest strips and one piece of smashed ginger in each of four mugs. Add about 1¼ cups boiling water to each mug and steep until fragrant, about 4 minutes. Add honey to taste to each mug and stir to combine. Holding the mint sprigs by their stems, slap them against the back of your hand or forearm (to help release their fragrance). Add one sprig to each mug and serve.

## Potion of Restoration

**Serves** 2

15 large blackberries

1 tablespoon sugar

1½ ounces fresh lemon juice

3 ounces gin

½ teaspoon butterfly pea powder (optional)

Roughly cracked or small ice cubes

1 ounce crème de mure (blackberry liqueur)

2 lemon zest twists for garnish

The drinks have a purple hue from the muddled blackberries, but to make the color extra vibrant, use the butterfly pea powder, which creates a vivid magenta color in the presence of an acid, such as lemon juice. Butterfly pea powder is available online and at some natural foods stores with a good selection of herbs and spices.

Crème de mure is a blackberry liqueur. If you can't find it, crème de cassis, a black currant liqueur, is a fine substitute.

In a cocktail shaker, muddle together 11 of the blackberries, the sugar, and lemon juice until the sugar dissolves fully. Add the gin and butterfly pea powder (if using). Fill the shaker about halfway with ice. Cover and shake to blend and chill, 30 seconds. Fill two chilled old-fashion or rocks glasses about halfway with ice and strain half the mixture into each, then pour ½ ounce crème de mure over the ice in each. Run one lemon twist around the rim of each glass and drop it in; add two of the remaining blackberries to each glass and serve at once.

## Rollrum

**Serves** 2

1½ tablespoons sugar

1½ ounces water

20 large mint leaves, plus 2 sprigs for garnish

Small ice cubes or coarsely crushed ice

4 ounces absinthe

4 ounces seltzer, cold (optional)

Although less potent in terms of alcohol content, you can substitute other anise-flavored liqueurs, such as pastis, Pernod, Herbsaint, or even ouzo, for the absinthe.

In a cocktail shaker, muddle the sugar and water until the sugar dissolves and the liquid is syrupy. Add the mint leaves and muddle gently to bruise them and release their fragrance (do not pulverize). Fill the shaker about halfway with ice and add the absinthe. Cover and shake to blend and chill, 30 seconds. Fill two chilled old-fashioned, rocks, or small Collins glasses about halfway with ice and divide the mixture between them. If using, add half the seltzer to each and stir gently to blend. Holding the mint sprigs by their stems, slap them against the back of your hand or forearm (to help release their fragrance), garnish each glass with a sprig, and serve at once.

## The Mindflayer

**Serves** 2

3 tablespoons peeled and chopped fresh ginger

¼ cup sugar

⅓ cup fresh lime juice

½ cup thawed grape juice concentrate

5 ounces vodka, cold

3 cups small ice cubes or coarsely crushed ice

Several black or red seedless grapes for garnish (optional)

In a blender, combine the ginger, sugar, and lime juice until the solids are a very, very fine puree and the mixture is uniformly syrupy, about 1 minute. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a measuring cup or bowl and strain the mixture, stirring and pressing on the solids to extract as much syrup as possible (you should have about ½ cup). Discard the solids and return the syrup to the blender.

Add the grape juice concentrate, vodka, and ice and blend until the ice is finely crushed and the mixture is uniform and moves easily in the blender jar (the timing will depend on the power of your blender). Divide the mixture between two roomy highball or Collins glasses, garnish with the grapes (if using), and serve at once, with straws if desired.

---

## Zzar

**Serves** 2

¼ cup heavy cream, cold

1 teaspoon confectioners' or granulated sugar

3½ ounces amaretto

Small ice cubes

1½ ounces coffee-flavored liqueur, such as Kahlua

½ cup whole milk

The ice in the shaker provides sufficient dilution, especially since there are no hard spirits in the cocktail, which is why the quantity of ice in the glasses is limited.

Using an electric handheld mixer, a whisk, or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the cream and sugar together until thickened and the whisk just begins to leave a trail. Add ½ ounce of the amaretto and beat briefly, until the cream is very softly whipped; refrigerate until needed.

Fill a cocktail shaker about halfway with ice and add the remaining 3 ounces amaretto, the coffee liqueur, and milk. Cover and shake to blend and chill, 30 seconds. Place two ice cubes in each of two chilled old-fashioned or rocks glasses and divide the mixture between them. Very gently spoon a portion of the whipped cream into each glass so it floats on the surface of the liquid and serve at once.

## Cherrybread

**Makes** one 9-inch loaf

¾ cup golden raisins

2 tablespoons dark or amber rum

¾ cup all-purpose flour

½ teaspoon baking powder

¼ teaspoon baking soda

Kosher salt

⅓ cup packed light brown sugar

1⅓ cups packed dried apricot halves

¾ cup dried cherries or cranberries

3 cups walnut halves, lightly toasted and cooled

3 eggs

2 tablespoons unsulphured molasses (not blackstrap)

½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

If you vary the type of dried fruit used, cut larger ones, like dates or figs, into smaller pieces. Make sure to include cherries or cranberries for the tart edge to their sweetness. This bread is an excellent accompaniment to a cheese platter.

In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine the raisins and rum, cover, and microwave until warm, about 1 minute. Set the bowl aside, still covered, until the raisins absorb most of the rum and soften, about 1 hour, stirring once or twice during that time. Drain off any excess liquid.

Preheat the oven to 300°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Butter a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan. Fold two long sheets of parchment paper and lay one crosswise in the pan and lay one lengthwise, pushing the parchment paper into the corners and smoothing the paper so it lies flush in the pan, with the ends overhanging all four sides of the pan. Generously butter the parchment paper in the pan.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, ½ teaspoon salt, and the brown sugar (make sure to break up any lumps in the brown sugar). Add the apricots, cherries, and raisins and toss to coat well. Add the walnuts and toss to combine.

In a small bowl, beat together the eggs, molasses, and vanilla until well blended. Add to the fruit-nut mixture and, using a flexible spatula, fold and mix to combine and coat all the dried fruit and nut pieces with batter (make sure there are no pockets of dry ingredients left at the bottom of the bowl). Scrape the mixture into the prepared pan and smooth it into an even, compact layer.

Bake for about 1 hour, rotating the pan 180 degrees halfway through. If, at that time, the top is browning too much, tent loosely with foil. When the cake is a deep golden brown, transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool completely.

Grab the parchment paper overhangs and remove the loaf from the pan. With a serrated knife, cut it into thin slices, and serve. Leftovers can be wrapped well and stored in an airtight container at room temperature for about 1 week.

## Dragon Salmon

**Serves** 4

1½ pounds skin-on salmon fillet, pinbones removed if necessary, cut crosswise into 4 equal pieces, and blotted dry

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 tablespoons neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 shallot, finely chopped

1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme

⅔ cup fruity, medium-bodied red wine, such as Pinot Noir, Côtes du Rhône, or Zinfandel

⅓ cup low-sodium chicken broth

1½ tablespoons minced fresh chives for garnish

Preheat the oven to 200°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.

Sprinkle the salmon lightly with salt and pepper.

In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil until shimmering. Add the salmon flesh-side down, leaving at least ¼ inch of space around the pieces, and cook, undisturbed, until the bottoms of the fillets start to turn opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Gently flip the fillets skin-side down, and cook, again undisturbed, until they are no longer translucent on the exterior and are firm when gently pressed, about 3 minutes for rare or 4 minutes for medium. Transfer the salmon to a heatproof plate, tent loosely with foil, and place it in the oven to keep warm.

Wipe out the skillet, add 1 tablespoon of the butter, and melt it over medium-low heat. Add the shallot, thyme, and ¼ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring constantly, until the shallot softens, about 1 minute. Add the wine and broth, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring the mixture to a simmer, occasionally stirring and scraping the bottom of the skillet to loosen and dissolve any browned bits. Continue simmering until reduced by about two-thirds, 6 to 8 minutes longer, adding any accumulated salmon juices midway through. Adjust the heat to low, add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, ¼ teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. And stir constantly while the butter melts and incorporates into the sauce. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, if necessary. Pour or spoon the sauce over or around the salmon, sprinkle with the chives, and serve hot.

## Drow Mushroom Steaks

**Serves** 6

3 tablespoons olive oil

2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves

½ teaspoon kosher salt

Freshly ground black pepper

6 large portobello mushrooms caps (stems removed and discarded)

In a shallow dish wide enough to hold the mushrooms in a single layer, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, thyme, salt, and several grinds of pepper. Put the mushrooms in the dish. Set aside to marinate at room temperature for 15 minutes, turning the mushrooms over and spooning the marinade on them halfway through.

Heat an outdoor grill or indoor grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the mushrooms, flipping to cook both sides, until tender and browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature.

## Elven Bread

**Makes** two 8½-inch loaves

#### Dough

2 packages (¼ ounce each) active dry yeast

1½ cups whole milk, lukewarm (110° to 115°F)

½ cup honey

2 eggs, beaten, plus 1 egg for egg wash

¼ cup unsalted butter, melted

2 teaspoons kosher salt

1 cup whole-wheat flour

5 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling

#### Filling

½ cup sugar

1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

1 tablespoon ground cinnamon

Brush the bread with an egg wash before sprinkling on the filling—the egg wash prevents any gaps from forming in the swirl while the bread bakes.

This bread works great as a midday snack, a post-dinner treat, or toasted and buttered for breakfast.

If you prefer more of a dessert bread, double the quantity of cinnamon-sugar filling.

***Make the Dough.*** In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, dissolve the yeast in ¼ cup of the lukewarm milk. Add the remaining 1¼ cups milk, the honey, the 2 beaten eggs, the butter, salt, whole-wheat flour, and all-purpose flour. Mix until well combined. Switch to the dough hook attachment and mix on low speed until the dough is elastic and somewhat sticky, about 8 minutes. Alternatively, you can mix and knead the dough by hand on a work surface for about 15 minutes; it's okay if it feels a little sticky.

Put the dough in a lightly greased large bowl, flipping the dough once to grease the top and bottom. Cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.

***While the Dough Is Rising, Make the Filling.*** Combine the sugar, flour, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Set aside.

In a separate bowl, beat the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water to make an egg wash.

Generously butter two 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pans. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface, divide in half, and roll one piece into a 6 by 20-inch rectangle. Brush the dough with the egg wash, then evenly sprinkle with the cinnamon-sugar filling. Starting with one of the short sides, roll the dough into a log. Repeat with the remaining dough, egg wash, and filling. Place the logs, seam-sides down, in the prepared loaf pans. Cover and set aside in a warm place to rise until the center of the dough has crested about 1 inch over the rim of the pan, 1½ to 2 hours.

Fifteen minutes before the dough is ready to bake, preheat the oven to 400°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.

Bake for 10 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 350°F and bake until the loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the loaves from the pans and let cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.

## Elven Marruth

**Makes** about 12 pastries

1 small yellow onion, finely chopped

1 small Yukon gold potato, peeled and cut into ½-inch pieces

2 carrots, peeled and finely chopped

2 cups packed finely chopped green cabbage

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme, plus 1½ tablespoons picked whole thyme leaves

¾ teaspoon soy sauce

¼ cup chopped fresh dill

All-purpose flour for dusting

Pastry for 2 double-crust pies (about 1½ pounds), thawed if frozen

1 egg

Preheat the oven to 375°F with the racks in the upper-middle and lower-middle of the oven. Line two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick (silicone) liners.

In a bowl, combine the onion, potato, carrots, cabbage, and olive oil and toss to coat the vegetables with the oil. Add ½ teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and toss to distribute. Transfer the mixture to one of the prepared baking sheets, spreading it into a thin, even layer (set the bowl aside).

Roast the vegetables on either rack until tender, 25 to 30 minutes, stirring and turning the vegetables two or three times. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, add the chopped thyme, and stir to incorporate it. Spread out the mixture and allow to cool to room temperature for about 20 minutes. Leave the oven on for more baking.

Return the cooled vegetables to the now-empty bowl. Stir in the soy sauce, dill, ¾ teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Adjust the seasoning, if necessary, and set aside until needed.

Replace the parchment paper on the baking sheet or wash the nonstick liner and return it to the baking sheet. Have a small bowl of water handy.

Dust a large sheet of parchment paper with flour. If you are working with homemade pie pastry, divide the dough into two balls. Working with one ball of homemade pastry, or one sheet of store-bought pastry, roll the dough into a 12-inch circle. Sprinkle half of the whole thyme leaves evenly over the pastry, cover with another sheet of parchment paper, and roll lightly to help the thyme stick. Flip the pastry over so the thyme leaves are on the bottom, and set aside. Repeat with the remaining pastry and remaining whole thyme leaves.

With a 4-inch round biscuit or cookie cutter, cut six circles out of each pastry round, patching together scraps if necessary, for a total of twelve circles. Working with six of the pastry circles, place about 1½ tablespoons of the vegetable mixture in the center of each round, leaving a ½-inch border around the edge. Working with one piece of pastry at a time, moisten the edge of the pastry circle and fold the pastry over the filling to make a half-moon shape. Press out any trapped air, press the edges firmly to seal, and, using a fork, crimp the edges for decoration and to secure the seal. Repeat with the remaining pastry rounds and filling, and transfer onto the prepared baking sheets.

In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush the top and sides of each marruth with the mixture. Bake until the marruths are light golden brown and crisp, about 25 minutes, rotating the sheets 180 degrees and switching racks halfway through the baking. Set the baking sheets on wire racks, cool the pastries for about 5 minutes, and serve hot.

## Feywild Eggs

**Serves** 4

9 eggs

¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

⅓ cup finely chopped mixed fresh herbs, such as parsley, basil, dill, mint, tarragon, lovage, or celery leaves

½ teaspoon kosher salt

Freshly ground black pepper

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

1 yellow onion, finely chopped

5 ounces Fontina, Colby, Monterey Jack, Havarti, or Gouda cheese, finely diced (about ½ cup)

Feywild eggs take well to all sorts of additions, including vegetables such as sautéed bell peppers, sliced mushrooms, asparagus, zucchini, or scallions, and meats such as crumbled cooked bacon, thinly sliced or crumbled cooked sausage, or sautéed diced ham steak. Whichever ingredients are added, use no more than 2 cups and make sure they are cooked and seasoned in the skillet before adding the eggs.

Make sure the skillet you choose is oven-safe to 400°F.

Preheat the oven to 400°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.

In a bowl, beat together the eggs, Parmesan cheese, herbs, salt, and a few grinds of pepper until uniformly blended.

In a 10-inch nonstick, oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Pour in the egg mixture and cook undisturbed until the edges begin to set and bubbles begin to appear in the center, about 1 minute. Sprinkle the diced cheese evenly over the eggs, transfer the skillet to the oven, and bake until the center is set and the frittata has puffed, about 14 minutes.

Gently run a flexible nonstick spatula around the edges of the frittata to loosen it and ease it onto a serving plate. Let cool for about 15 minutes, cut into wedges, and serve warm or at room temperature.

## Greenspear Bundles in Bacon

**Serves** 4

2 pounds (about 32) medium-thick asparagus spears, tough ends snapped off

1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

8 slices bacon

1½ tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives for garnish

When choosing asparagus, seek spears that are about ¾ inch thick at the base—about as thick as a highlighter; they will overcook if they are too slender (like a pencil).

If you prefer crispier bacon, use standard-cut instead of thick-cut bacon.

Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.

In a large bowl, toss the asparagus with the olive oil to coat. Sprinkle the asparagus very lightly with salt and pepper and toss again.

Put one slice of bacon on the work surface, lay four asparagus spears on it diagonally, and wrap the bacon around the asparagus, covering as much of the spears as possible and making sure the ends overlap; gently press the ends together to help them adhere. Working in groups of four asparagus spears, repeat with the remaining bacon slices and asparagus to form seven additional bundles.

On a large rimmed baking sheet, arrange the bundles, seam-side down, with about 1 inch of space around them. Roast until the bacon and asparagus are cooked through and spotted brown, about 15 minutes.

Transfer the bundles to a serving platter, sprinkle with the chives, and serve at once.

## High Harvest Puree

**Serves** 4

One 4-pound butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes

4 large garlic cloves, unpeeled

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1½ teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme

Mashing the squash right on the baking sheet yields a dense, rustic puree. If you want to make it smooth, scrape the squash and peeled garlic into a food processor and pulse or process it to a desired smoothness. If you want a looser consistency, with the processor running, gradually add ½ to ⅔ cup of hot water through the feed tube.

Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.

In a large bowl, toss the squash and garlic cloves with the olive oil. Add ¾ teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and toss to distribute. On a large rimmed baking sheet, spread out the squash into a single layer and roast until tender, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle the thyme over the squash, stir it in, and continue to roast for 10 minutes more. Set the baking sheet on a stable, heatproof surface.

Slip the peels off the garlic cloves; discard the peels and return the cloves to the squash. With a potato masher, mash the squash to a desired texture. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary. Scrape the puree into a serving bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and serve.

---

## Meal's End

**Serves** 4

3 cups fresh strawberries, rinsed and hulled (or a mix of berries)

Sugar as needed

1⅓ cups heavy cream

⅓ cup plain Greek yogurt (preferably whole milk) or crème fraîche

¼ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

2 ounces packaged or homemade cocoa or vanilla meringues, coarsely crumbled (about 1⅓ cups)

Serve the Meal's End immediately after making it because time is unkind to the texture of the meringues.

If you feel that your berries require a flavor boost, add about 1 tablespoon of pomegranate juice or berry liqueur, orange liqueur, port, or even cognac.

You can substitute blueberries, blackberries, or peeled and cubed persimmons for the 1 cup sliced or quartered strawberries.

Coarsely chop 2 cups of the strawberries. In a bowl, mix the chopped strawberries with sugar to taste. Slice or quarter the remaining 1 cup berries. In a small bowl, mix these strawberries with sugar to taste.

With a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, a handheld electric mixer, or a whisk, beat the cream until it is softly whipped, adding 1 tablespoon sugar once the cream has thickened. This will take 1 to 1½ minutes with a stand mixer on high speed. Fold in the yogurt and vanilla just until blended. Fold in the chopped berries and crumbled meringues.

Divide the mixture among four serving dishes, top with the sliced berries, and serve at once.

## Moonshae Seafood Rice

**Serves** 4

4 cups fish or seafood stock

¼ teaspoon crushed saffron threads

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

1 onion, finely chopped

Kosher salt

1½ cups Arborio rice

¾ cup dry white wine, at room temperature

12 ounces shelled, deveined extra-large shrimp (21 to 25 shrimp per pound), halved lengthwise

12 ounces dry sea scallops, halved lengthwise

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

3 tablespoons minced chives for garnish

The exact volume of liquid required for the rice to fully cook can vary. Occasionally, the quantity falls a bit short of the 4 cups in the recipe, but sometimes it takes the full amount.

Note that you have to keep the broth warm while you prepare the rice.

In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring the stock to a simmer. Adjust the heat to low and keep warm. In a small bowl, mix together about ½ cup of the warm stock and the saffron, stirring until the liquid is tinted, and set aside.

In a large saucepan over medium heat, warm the oil until shimmering. Add the onion and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring constantly, until the edges of the grains begin to turn translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the wine, adjust the heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring frequently, until the wine is absorbed into the rice, about 2 minutes. Add 1 cup of the warm stock and cook, stirring frequently, until it is absorbed into the rice, about 5 minutes. Repeat the process twice more, adding 1 cup stock each time.

Sprinkle the shrimp and scallops lightly with salt, add them to the rice, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Add the reserved saffron-stock and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until it is absorbed and the rice is fragrant and tinted and appears moist and creamy, about 3 minutes more. The rice grains should be al dente—cooked through, but still with a touch of resistance to the bite—and the shrimp and scallops should be just cooked through and opaque. Add the butter and stir to melt and incorporate. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt. Adjust the consistency with additional stock, if necessary, stirring until it is incorporated. Serve hot, sprinkling each portion with some of the chives.

## Qualinesti Vegetable Stew

**Serves** 4

⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil

5 garlic cloves, finely chopped

2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme

1 large yellow onion, finely chopped

Kosher salt

1 (15-ounce) can tomato puree

1 teaspoon sugar

Freshly ground black pepper

¼ cup chopped fresh basil

1 zucchini, sliced ¼ inch thick

1 yellow squash, sliced ¼ inch thick

1 Japanese or Chinese eggplant, sliced ¼ inch thick

4 plum tomatoes, sliced ¼ inch thick

Japanese and Chinese eggplants are long and slender, with a diameter similar to that of zucchini or the fat end of yellow squash. If you use globe eggplant instead, choose the skinniest one you can find and cut the slices to a similar size as the squashes and tomatoes. Make sure the curved side faces out when you arrange them in the skillet.

Preheat the oven to 375°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.

In a 12-inch ovenproof skillet over medium heat, combine ¼ cup of the olive oil, half the garlic, and the thyme and cook, stirring, until fragrant and the garlic just begins to sizzle, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the mixture into a small bowl and set aside.

Add the remaining oil to the skillet over medium heat and allow the oil to warm until shimmering. Add the onion and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the remaining garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomato puree, sugar, and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 7 minutes. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt, if necessary, and set aside off the heat to cool slightly. Add 2 tablespoons of the basil and stir to mix; spread and smooth the mixture into an even layer in the skillet.

Working in concentric circles from the edges of the skillet toward the middle, neatly shingle the sliced zucchini, yellow squash, eggplant, and tomatoes, alternating and overlapping the vegetables and packing them tightly in a single layer. Drizzle the reserved garlic-thyme oil evenly over the vegetables and sprinkle with about ¾ teaspoon salt and ¾ teaspoon pepper. Cover the skillet and bake until the vegetables begin to soften, about 30 minutes. Remove the cover and continue baking until the vegetables are very tender and bubbling around the edges of the skillet, about 20 minutes more.

Rest the dish for 10 minutes, sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons basil and serve.

## Quith-pa

**Makes** 15 or 16 balls

1 orange

6 ounces (1 cup) dried apricots, coarsely chopped

¾ cup unsweetened shredded coconut, toasted

¾ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Kosher salt

Using a Microplane, grate the orange peel to yield 1½ teaspoons of finely grated zest. Squeeze the orange to yield 1½ tablespoons of juice.

In a full-size or mini food processor, combine the apricots, ¼ cup of the coconut, the orange zest and juice, vanilla, and a tiny pinch of salt. Process until the mixture is very finely chopped, uniform, and cohesive, pulsing and stopping to scrape down the sides of the work bowl as necessary. Scrape the mixture into a small bowl. Put the remaining ½ cup coconut in a wide, shallow bowl.

Roll scant 1-tablespoon portions of the apricot mixture into 1-inch balls, gently pressing as you roll to help them cohere (you should have 15 or 16 balls). Working with three or four balls at a time, roll them in the remaining coconut, pressing them gently to help the coconut adhere. Place the balls on a plate and rest them (to firm up and dry out slightly) for 45 minutes. The balls will keep, stored in an airtight container at room temperature, for about 3 days.

## Chicken-Something Dumplings

**Serves** 4

#### Chicken Stew

6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (2 to 2½ pounds)

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 teaspoons olive oil

2 leeks, white and light green parts, halved lengthwise

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

2 bay leaves

2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme, or 1 teaspoon dried

5 garlic cloves, finely chopped

3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

½ cup dry sherry, such as Amontillado

2 cups low-sodium chicken broth

2 carrots, peeled and diagonally cut into 1-inch slices

2 celery stalks, trimmed and diagonally cut into 1-inch slices

⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley

#### Dumplings

1¾ cups all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons baking powder

2 teaspoons onion powder

1 teaspoon kosher salt

Freshly ground black pepper

6 scallions, green and white parts, thinly sliced

2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces

2 tablespoons olive oil or reserved chicken fat (from browning the chicken)

¾ cup whole milk

TO MAKE THE STEW, sprinkle the chicken thighs all over with salt and pepper. In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Arrange half the chicken skin-side down in the Dutch oven, adjust the heat to medium, and cook, undisturbed, until the skin is browned, about 5 minutes. Turn over the chicken and continue to cook, undisturbed, until the second side is browned, about 5 minutes more; adjust the heat if it starts to scorch. Transfer the chicken to a large plate. Repeat with the remaining chicken thighs (and reserve any accumulated chicken fat). When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin.

Thinly slice one of the leek halves. Cut the remaining three leek halves into 1-inch pieces.

Add the butter to the pot, return it to medium heat, and melt and swirl in the pot to coat. Add the thinly sliced leeks, bay leaves, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring constantly, until the leeks are softened, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and flour and continue to cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes more. Add the sherry and bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping the pan bottom to loosen and dissolve any browned bits. Continue to simmer, stirring, until the liquid is thickened and slightly reduced, about 1 minute more. Gradually add the broth, stirring vigorously to incorporate it smoothly.

Add the chicken thighs with any of the accumulated juices to the pot and return to a simmer. Adjust the heat to very low, cover, and simmer gently until the chicken is cooked through and very tender, about 1 hour, turning the chicken pieces over after about 30 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate.

When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones and shred it into large chunks. Remove the bay leaves from the pot, add the shredded chicken, ½ teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper; stir to mix. Over medium-high heat, return to a simmer. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary.

MEANWHILE, MAKE THE DUMPLINGS. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, onion powder, salt, and a few grinds of pepper in a bowl. Add the scallions and toss to combine. In a microwave-safe bowl, microwave the butter and olive oil (or reserved chicken fat, if you have any), stopping to swirl occasionally, to melt the butter. Add the milk and continue to microwave on high until the mixture is just warm (do not overheat), about 1½ minutes. Add the warmed milk mixture to the flour mixture. With a wooden spoon or fork, mix until incorporated and uniformly moist (the mixture should look like a wet, shaggy dough).

To finish the chicken and cook the dumplings, add the carrots, celery, 1-inch leek pieces, and most of the parsley to the stew and stir to incorporate it. Using a soup spoon, drop twelve golf ball–size portions of dumpling dough into the pot, placing them about ½ inch apart (drop eight around the perimeter and four in the center). Adjust the heat to low, cover, and cook undisturbed until the dumplings are puffed and cooked through, and a toothpick inserted into them comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.

Ladle the stew into bowls, allowing three dumplings per portion. Sprinkle each with some of the remaining parsley and serve.

## Community Cheeses

**Serves** 4 to 6

#### Dippers

Broccoli and/or cauliflower, trimmed and cut into bite-size florets

Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved

Roasted or steamed potatoes, cubed

Apples and/or pears, peeled, if desired, cored, and cut into bite-size pieces (toss with a small amount of fresh lemon juice to slow browning)

Ham steak, sautéed until lightly browned, and cut into bite-size pieces

Baguette or other good French bread, cut into bite-size pieces (each with some crust)

Raisin bread or dried fruit-nut bread or rolls, lightly toasted and cut into bite-size pieces

#### Fondue

12 ounces Gruyère cheese, coarsely grated (4 cups, lightly packed), at room temperature

12 ounces Emmental cheese, coarsely grated (4 cups, lightly packed), at room temperature

1⅔ cups crisp, dry white wine

2 tablespoons cornstarch

3 garlic cloves, smashed

1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

2 tablespoons Kirsch or Poire Williams

Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg (optional)

Kosher salt and freshly ground black or white pepper

There is a lot of variation in the way cheeses melt. To increase your odds of a smooth outcome, use grated cheese at room temperature. Many experts advise using cheeses that are younger than a year old and avoiding those sourced from supermarket deli counters.

Cheeses can differ in saltiness, so season the fondue carefully. Start with ½ teaspoon kosher salt, and taste. If necessary, add more salt by the ¼ teaspoon.

PREPARE THE DIPPERS. Blanch the broccoli or cauliflower in boiling salted water until just tender, about 4 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Then drain until dry or blot dry.

MAKE THE FONDUE. In a large bowl, mix the Gruyère and Emmental cheeses and set aside. In a small bowl, whisk ⅓ cup of the wine and the cornstarch to blend, and set aside.

In a heavy saucepan over medium heat, combine the remaining 1⅓ cups of wine and two of the garlic cloves and bring to a simmer. Remove the garlic, whisk the cornstarch mixture to recombine, add it to the pan, and stir constantly, until thickened, 15 to 30 seconds. Stir in the lemon juice.

Adjust the heat to medium-low and add about ½ cup of the cheese, stirring constantly but gently until fully melted. Repeat with the remaining cheeses in ½-cup increments, each time stirring until melted fully before adding more, about 8 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring constantly but gently, until the mixture is smooth and just begins to bubble, about 4 minutes more. Do not allow the mixture to boil; adjust the heat, if necessary. Add the Kirsch, nutmeg (if using), ½ teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Stir to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

Meanwhile, warm a fondue pot with hot water, empty it, and dry it well. Rub the inside of the pot with the remaining garlic clove and pour in the fondue. Set the pot over a heat source, and serve at once with the dippers.

## Everything Soup

**Serves** 6

6 tablespoons unsalted butter

2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh rosemary

2 garlic cloves, finely chopped

Kosher salt

1 large yellow onion, chopped

3 rainbow carrots, peeled and diagonally cut into ¾-inch slices

1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into ¾-inch pieces

2 large bay leaves

1½ teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme, or ¾ teaspoon dried

5 cups low-sodium chicken broth

1 Yukon gold potato (about 6 ounces), peeled and cut into ¾-inch cubes

4 ounces green beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces

1 small leek, white and light green parts, halved lengthwise, thinly sliced, rinsed thoroughly, and drained

¾ cup frozen corn kernels

1½ cups (8 ounces) bite-size or shredded skinless pieces of home-cooked or rotisserie chicken

Freshly ground black pepper

In a small skillet over medium heat, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter. Add the rosemary, garlic, and a tiny pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and set the skillet aside for the butter to infuse.

In a Dutch oven or large saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter. Add the onion, carrots, red pepper, bay leaves, thyme, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium-low, cover, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have released their juices, about 8 minutes. Add the broth and potato, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring the liquid to a simmer. Adjust the heat to very low, cover, and simmer until the potato is barely tender, about 5 minutes. Add the green beans, adjust the heat to medium-high, and return the liquid to a simmer. Adjust the heat to very low, cover, and simmer until the green beans are barely tender, about 3 minutes more. Add the leek, corn, chicken, ¾ teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper; adjust the heat to medium-high; and return the liquid to a simmer. Adjust the heat to very low, cover, and simmer until the potato is fully tender, the green beans are tender-crisp, the leeks are wilted, and the corn and chicken are heated through, about 3 minutes more. Remove the bay leaves. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

Return the rosemary-garlic butter to medium heat to melt. Strain the butter through a fine-mesh strainer. Serve the soup, drizzling a teaspoon or two of the flavored butter on the surface of each serving.

## Halfling Oatmeal Sweet Nibbles

**Makes** about 45 cookies

1½ cups all-purpose flour

2 cups rolled oats

1 teaspoon baking soda

½ teaspoon kosher salt

1½ cups packed light brown sugar

1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature

1 egg, beaten

2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

1 cup butterscotch chips

Smaller cookies will affect the cook time and later batches will cook noticeably faster if you are using the same baking sheet. For softer cookies, try cutting the cook time by a quarter.

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick (silicone) liners.

In a bowl, stir together the flour, oats, baking soda, and salt.

In a large bowl, beat together the brown sugar and butter until light and creamy. Mix in the egg and vanilla. Add the flour mixture and stir until incorporated. Stir in the chocolate chips and butterscotch chips.

Scoop the dough by the rounded tablespoon and place about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. You'll need to bake a second batch of cookies because they won't all fit on the two baking sheets. (It's okay to reuse the parchment paper.)

Bake for 15 minutes, rotating the positions of the baking sheets halfway through, until the cookies are golden brown and a little darker around the edges. Let cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining dough. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.

## Heartlands Rose Apple and Blackberry Pie

**Makes** one 9-inch deep-dish pie

⅔ cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar

½ teaspoon ground cinnamon

3 tablespoons cornstarch

Kosher salt

3½ pounds (about 6) baking apples (such as Golden Delicious, Ginger Gold, Jonathan, Jonagold, Honeycrisp, Cortland, or Empire), peeled, quartered, cored, and cut lengthwise into ¼-inch slices

Pastry for 2 double-crust pies, thawed if frozen and rested at room temperature until pliable without cracking, about 30 minutes

12 ounces (about 2½ cups) blackberries, rinsed

1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

1½ tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces

1 egg

Lightly sweetened whipped cream for serving (optional)

n a large microwave-safe bowl, mix ⅓ cup of the sugar, the cinnamon, 1 tablespoon of the cornstarch, and ¼ teaspoon salt. Add the apples and toss gently to combine. Microwave the mixture until the apples just begin to soften and release juices, 7 to 10 minutes, stirring gently with a flexible spatula every 2 to 3 minutes. Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

On a floured work surface or sheet of parchment paper, roll out one piece of pastry into a 12-inch circle. Transfer the pastry into a deep-dish pie plate, fitting it in by gently lifting the edge of the pastry with one hand while lightly pressing it into the plate bottom and up the sides with the other hand; leave an overhang of about 1 inch. Refrigerate until the pastry is firm, about 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 425°F with a large baking sheet on a rack in the lower-middle position in the oven.

In a bowl, mix together ⅓ cup of the sugar, the remaining 2 tablespoons cornstarch, and a tiny pinch of salt. Add the blackberries and gently toss to coat. Add the lemon juice and gently fold until the sugar mixture is moistened and syrupy. Spread the blackberry mixture evenly into the dough-lined pie plate and scatter the butter pieces over the berry mixture. With a slotted spoon, spoon the apples evenly over the berries and mound them slightly in the center. Pour about half of the exuded juices over the apples.

On a floured work surface or sheet of parchment paper, roll out the second piece of pastry into a 12-inch circle. Place the pastry over the apples, leaving an overhang of about 1 inch. Using kitchen shears, cut evenly through both layers of overhanging pastry, leaving an overhang of about ½ inch. Fold the pastry under itself so that the edge of the fold is even with the edge of the pie plate and flute the pastry using your thumb and forefinger, or crimp it with the tines of a fork, to seal.

In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush onto the top of the pie (you'll probably have some left over). Sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar evenly over the top. Set the pie on the preheated baking sheet and bake until the top is light golden brown, about 25 minutes. Adjust the temperature to 375°F, rotate the baking sheet 180 degrees, and continue baking until the crust is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes more.

Set the pie on a wire rack and let it cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Serve with whipped cream, if desired.

## Hogs in Bedrolls

**Makes** about 40 rolls

1 to 2 sheet(s) frozen all-butter puff pastry (see Cook's Note), thawed according to package directions

1 (12-ounce) package cocktail franks

1 egg

Ketchup, mustard, barbecue sauce, or steak sauce for dipping (optional)

The measurements of different brands of puff pastry sheets differ, but most include two sheets.

Many cocktail franks measure about 1½ inches in length. If yours differ, adjust the size of your puff pastry squares accordingly, keeping them about ½ inch longer and wider than the franks. If you can't find cocktail franks, buy the most slender hot dogs you can and cut them into 1½-inch lengths. If the hot dogs are fatter than cocktail franks, though, you may have to adjust the size of your puff squares.

Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick (silicone) liners.

On a lightly floured work surface, unfold or unroll the puff pastry. If necessary, use a rolling pin to gently roll it flat (take care not to press too hard, which compresses the layers, decreasing its puff when baked). Cut as many 2-inch squares as you have cocktail franks. Lay each frank diagonally on a square, fold the two opposite corners up and over the frank to meet at the top, and press or pinch them to adhere. Arrange them about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.

In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush the top and sides of each bedroll with the mixture. Bake until the bedrolls are browned, puffed, and crisp, about 17 minutes, rotating the sheets 180 degrees and switching racks halfway through baking. Set the baking sheets on wire racks and let the bedrolls cool for about 5 minutes. Serve hot, with ketchup, mustard, barbecue sauce, or steak sauce on the side for dipping (if desired).

## Honey-Drizzled Cream Puffs

**Makes** 12 cream puffs

#### Puffs

1 egg, separated, plus 2 whole eggs

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

⅓ cup water

3 tablespoons whole milk

5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into several pieces

1½ tablespoons sugar

½ teaspoon kosher salt

⅔ cup all-purpose flour, sifted

#### Filling

1⅓ cups heavy cream, cold

3 tablespoons honey

⅓ cup crème fraîche, cold

¾ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

To enhance both the flavor and stability of the filling, add crème fraîche to the whipped cream.

***Make the Puffs.*** Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick (silicone) baking mat.

In a small bowl, beat the separated egg yolk with 1 teaspoon water and set aside. In a second small bowl, beat the separated egg white with the remaining two whole eggs and the vanilla and set aside.

In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the water, milk, butter, sugar, and salt and cook, stirring, until the butter has melted and the mixture is on the verge of boiling, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the flour all at once, and, with a wooden spoon, beat the mixture until a cohesive ball forms. Return the pan to medium-low heat and continue beating the dough, using a smearing motion, for 3 minutes, until the dough is very smooth and slightly drier.

Scrape the dough into a food processor and, with the feed tube open, process for about 10 seconds to cool it slightly. With the motor running, slowly pour in the beaten eggs through the feed tube and process until they are absorbed, about 10 seconds. Stop and scrape down the sides of the food processor bowl, then continue processing until the paste becomes thick, smooth, and sticky, about 15 seconds more.

Scrape the paste into a large plastic bag and, using your hands or a bench scraper, push it into one lower corner of the bag. Cut off ½ inch from the very corner of the bag and pipe the paste onto the prepared baking sheet in 2-inch mounds, leaving at least a ½-inch space around each one.

Dip a spoon into cold water and use the back of the spoon to even out the shape and smooth the surface of the mounds. Using a pastry brush, brush each mound with a small portion of the reserved egg yolk mixture.

Bake for 15 minutes, then adjust the oven temperature to 375°F and continue baking until golden brown and firm, 7 to 9 minutes more.

Remove the puffs from the oven and, with the tip of a paring knife, cut a ¾-inch slit into the side of each puff to release steam. Turn off the oven, place the puffs on the baking sheet, return to the oven, prop the door open with a wooden spoon, and allow the puffs to dry, until the centers are barely moist and the exteriors are crisp, about 40 minutes. Transfer the puffs to a wire rack to cool to room temperature.

***To Make the Filling.*** with a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, a handheld electric mixer, or a whisk, beat the cream until it is softly whipped, adding the honey once the cream has thickened. Add the crème fraîche and vanilla and continue to beat until the mixture holds very stiff peaks.

Just before serving, cut the puffs in half. Fill each bottom half with about ¼ cup of the filling, position the top halves on the filling, arrange on a serving platter, drizzle with honey, and serve.

## Honeyed Ham with Pineapple Gravy

**Serves** 10 to 14

1 small (10-pound) spiral-sliced, bone-in ham, preferably shank-end

2 cups unsweetened pineapple juice

¾ cup honey

⅓ cup packed light brown sugar

2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, plus 1 tablespoon

¼ teaspoon ground cloves, or to taste

Freshly ground black pepper

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 shallot, finely chopped

2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme

Kosher salt

1 tablespoon cornstarch

1 cup finely chopped fresh pineapple

Remove the ham from the refrigerator 1½ to 2 hours before cooking so that it starts at room temperature.

Preheat the oven to 300°F with a rack in the lower-middle of the oven. Cover a large roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet with foil. Set a roasting rack in the roasting pan and cover that with foil, shiny-side up, leaving overhangs sufficient to fully wrap the ham once it's on the rack. Position the ham cut-side down on the rack, cover with the overhanging foil, and crimp the edges to seal the ham. Bake until the ham registers about 120°F on an instant-read thermometer, 3 to 3½ hours.

At around the 3-hour mark, in a skillet over medium-high heat, bring the pineapple juice to a boil. Continue to boil until the juice is reduced to 1 cup, 8 to 10 minutes. Pour off and reserve ⅔ cup of the reduced juice for the sauce.

Add ½ cup of the honey, the brown sugar, 2 teaspoons mustard, cloves, and ½ teaspoon pepper, to the remaining ⅓ cup reduced juice in the skillet and whisk to combine.

Remove the ham from the oven and adjust the oven temperature to 400°F. Peel back the foil and, working carefully with the hot ham, pour as much of the accumulated ham juices as possible into a large measuring cup or bowl and set aside. Brush half the pineapple juice mixture evenly over the exposed surfaces of the ham (don't worry about the cut side). Leaving the foil open, bake until glossy and beginning to caramelize, about 15 minutes. Brush the remaining mixture over the ham and continue baking, again until glossy and caramelized, about 8 minutes more.

Remove the ham from the oven and again working carefully, pour as much of the accumulated ham juices as possible into the bowl with the first batch (you may have as much as 1½ cups) and set aside. Fold the foil back up over the ham to tent loosely and let rest for 15 minutes.

In a saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the shallot, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the shallot softens, about 2 minutes. Add the ⅔ cup reserved reduced pineapple juice, the remaining ¼ cup honey, and remaining 1 tablespoon mustard. Whisk to combine and bring to a simmer, about 2 minutes.

In a bowl or measuring cup, whisk the cornstarch and ⅔ cup of the reserved ham juices until uniform. Add to the saucepan and cook, stirring, until thickened, about 1 minute. Add the chopped pineapple and pepper to taste and cook, stirring, to heat the sauce through, 1 to 2 minutes more. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Carve the ham and serve with the warm sauce.

## Melted Cheeses with Chunky Tomato Broth

**Serves** 4

#### Tomato Broth

2 tablespoons salted butter

1 large onion, finely chopped

1 bay leaf

Kosher salt

1 tablespoon light brown sugar

1 tablespoon tomato paste

4 cups low-sodium chicken broth

2 tablespoons long-grain white rice

1 (28-ounce) can peeled whole tomatoes

Freshly ground black pepper

#### Melted Cheese Sandwiches

6 tablespoons salted butter, softened

8 (½-inch-thick) slices white or multigrain French, Italian, or sandwich bread

8 ounces firm or semifirm cheese (such as a young Cheddar, Colby, Monterey Jack, Fontina, Havarti, Gouda, or Baby Swiss), coarsely grated

1½ tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, dill, or chives for garnish

***Make the Soup.*** In a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onion, bay leaf, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and light golden, about 5 minutes. Add the brown sugar and tomato paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the chicken broth and rice. Reserve three tomatoes and add the remainder with the juices, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Adjust the heat to medium-low, cover, and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the rice is very tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the bay leaf.

In a countertop blender, or with an immersion blender, puree the tomato mixture until smooth; return the pureed mixture to the pot. Chop the reserved tomatoes, add to the soup, and stir. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, if necessary, and pepper. Cover and keep warm over very low heat.

***To Make the Melted Cheese Sandwiches.*** set a large nonstick or cast-iron griddle over medium-low heat.

Spread about 2 teaspoons of the softened butter on one side of four slices of the bread, all the way to the edges. Place them on the work surface buttered-sides down. Top each slice with about ½ cup of grated cheese. Spread the remaining softened butter on one side of each of the remaining four slices of bread. Place them on the sandwiches buttered-sides up. Transfer the sandwiches to the griddle or skillet and cook until golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Transfer the sandwiches to a cutting board and cut crosswise into four or five strips.

Serve the tomato broth and melted cheeses together, sprinkling each bowl of broth with the chopped herbs.

## Stuffed Egg-Battered Toast

**Serves** 4

4 ounces (½ cup) mascarpone, at room temperature

¼ cup walnuts, finely chopped

2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

4 (1-inch-thick) slices brioche or challah

2 eggs

½ cup whole milk

¼ teaspoon kosher salt

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

½ cup maple syrup

Confectioners' sugar for dusting

Stuffing the mascarpone mixture into the thick slices of brioche requires a delicate touch (or small fingers). If creating a pocket in the side of each slice is too much trouble, you can also cut the bread ½ inch thick and spread the mascarpone in between two slices, like a sandwich.

Marmalade, heated over low heat in a pan, makes for a delectable syrup replacement.

In a small bowl, stir together the mascarpone, walnuts, and vanilla.

Use a thin knife to cut a 2-inch-long slit through the side of each slice of brioche, creating a pocket. Gently open the pocket and spoon about 1 tablespoon of the mascarpone mixture into each slice.

In a pie dish or shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and salt.

Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip two stuffed slices into the egg mixture, turning to soak both sides and letting any excess batter drip back into the bowl. Place the slices in the skillet and cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until golden brown. Use a spatula to transfer the toasts to a warm plate. Repeat to cook the remaining two stuffed slices.

Meanwhile, warm the maple syrup in a small saucepan over low heat for a few minutes.

Dust the stuffed toast with confectioners' sugar, drizzle with the warm maple syrup, and serve.

## Amphail Braised Beef

**Serves** 4

3 pounds beef chuck roast, trimmed of excess fat

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 tablespoons neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

5 yellow onions, thickly sliced

1 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed

2 teaspoons ground ginger

1½ tablespoons all-purpose flour

1 cup sparkling hard cider, preferably pear

½ cup low-sodium chicken broth

3 ripe-but-firm Bosc, Bartlett, or Anjou pears, peeled, cored, and cut into 1-inch pieces

¾ teaspoon cider vinegar

¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

Set the beef on a cutting board, dry it with paper towels, tie it into a uniform shape with kitchen twine at 2-inch intervals, and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.

In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil until shimmering. Add the beef and cook, undisturbed, until deeply browned on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the beef and continue cooking, until well browned on each of the remaining three sides, 10 to 12 minutes more. Transfer the beef to a large bowl.

Return the pot to medium-high heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and warm until shimmering. Add the onions and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally, until the onions begin to soften and release some liquid, about 4 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium-low and continue cooking for 15 minutes, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally and adjusting the heat as necessary to make sure the onions are cooking gently, not scorching. Add the thyme, ginger, and flour and continue to cook, stirring, until the onions are sticky and golden, about 5 minutes more. Add the cider, broth, and ½ teaspoon salt. Stir and scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen and dissolve the browned bits.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 300°F with a rack in the lower-middle of the oven.

Nestle the beef into the onions (the onions and accumulated juices should come about three-fourths of the way up the sides of the meat). Cover the pot, transfer it to the oven, and cook for 1 hour 35 minutes. Add the pears, nestling them into the onions, return the pot to the oven, and continue to cook, covered, until the beef is extremely tender (a paring knife should slip easily into the meat) and it registers 200°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 2¼ hours more.

Transfer the beef to a cutting board and, using a large slotted spoon, spoon the onions and pears onto a serving platter; tent loosely with foil to keep warm. Pour the accumulated liquid into a measuring cup and let rest until all the fat rises to the surface, about 10 minutes. Tilt the measuring cup and use a wide, shallow soup spoon to skim the fat off the surface and discard it. Add the vinegar and most of the parsley to the defatted liquid and stir to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary.

Remove the twine from the beef and cut it against the grain into ½-inch-thick slices (or pull it apart into pieces). Place the meat on the platter with the onions and pears, pour the seasoned juices over the meat, sprinkle with the remaining parsley, and serve.

## Castle Amber Onion Soup

**Serves** 4

4 tablespoons unsalted butter

4 pounds (about 8) yellow onions, thinly sliced

Kosher salt

2 bay leaves

1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped

1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

½ cup dry sherry or dry white wine

4 cups low-sodium chicken broth

1½ cups low-sodium beef broth

Freshly ground black pepper

8 thin slices from a baguette

1 garlic clove, peeled and halved

1¼ cups grated Gruyère cheese

2 tablespoons snipped chives for garnish

In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter. Add the onions and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium, add the bay leaves, and continue cooking, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally, until the onions are light gold and sticky, about 1½ hours (adjust the heat as necessary to make sure they are caramelizing, not scorching).

Adjust the heat to medium-low. Add ¼ cup water and scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen and dissolve the brown bits. Continue to cook until the pot bottom is coated again, about 12 minutes, stirring and scraping occasionally. Add another ¼ cup water, and repeat this cooking and deglazing process two more times until all the water has evaporated and the onions are dark brown, about 12 minutes longer each time. Add the thyme and flour and continue to cook, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes.

Add the sherry to the pot, adjust the heat to medium-high, and continue to cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot constantly, for about 3 minutes longer. Add the chicken broth, beef broth, and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Adjust the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, to blend the flavors, about 30 minutes. Remove the bay leaves and stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Taste and adjust the seasoning with pepper and additional salt, if necessary.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Arrange the baguette slices on a baking sheet and bake until lightly golden, about 10 minutes, turning them over midway through that time.

Preheat the broiler and carefully set the oven rack about 6 inches below the heat element. Lightly rub each toast with the raw garlic clove; sprinkle with pepper and the Gruyère, and broil until the cheese is melted and browned in spots, about 4 minutes.

Ladle the soup into four warmed bowls, garnish with two cheese toasts each, sprinkle with the chives, and serve at once.

## Dark Molasses Nutbread

**Makes** one 8½-inch loaf

¾ cup all-purpose flour

¾ cup rye flour

¾ cup fine or medium-ground yellow cornmeal

¾ teaspoon baking soda

½ teaspoon baking powder

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1½ cups coarsely chopped toasted walnuts

1 cup buttermilk

½ cup unsulphured molasses (not blackstrap)

¼ cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled

Rye flour is available from Bob's Red Mill and is sometimes found in the bulk department of a supermarket or natural foods store.

Preheat the oven to 350°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Butter and flour an 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pan and tap out the excess (or coat with nonstick baking spray).

In a bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, rye flour, cornmeal, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add the walnuts and stir to distribute.

In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, molasses, and melted butter (the butter will clump, which is fine).

Make a well in the center of the dry mixture, add the wet mixture, and, using a flexible spatula, fold and stir until the wet and dry ingredients are just incorporated (do not overmix). Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.

Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through, until the loaf is firm to the touch, the edges pull away from the pan slightly, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Cool the bread in the pan on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Turn out the loaf, place it right-side up on the rack, and cool to room temperature. To serve, slice with a serrated knife.

## Gingerbread Man

**Makes** 24 cookies

#### Cookies

3 cups all-purpose flour

¾ cup packed dark brown sugar

1 tablespoon ground ginger

2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

¾ teaspoon baking soda

¾ teaspoon kosher salt

¾ teaspoon dry mustard powder

½ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

⅛ teaspoon ground cloves

12 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled

⅔ cup unsulphured molasses (not blackstrap)

3 tablespoons whole milk

½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

#### Decoration

⅔ cup currants or raisins

⅓ cup very finely chopped toasted walnuts

1⅓ cups confectioners' sugar

1 egg white

¼ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Kosher salt

***Make the Cookies.*** In a food processor, combine the flour, brown sugar, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, mustard powder, nutmeg, and cloves. Pulse several times to mix. Add the melted butter, molasses, milk, and vanilla and process until the ingredients are combined into a dough with no remaining streaks of flour, 15 to 30 seconds, stopping to scrape down the sides of the work bowl as necessary.

Dust a work surface very lightly with flour, scrape the dough onto it, and knead briefly until the dough forms a cohesive ball. Divide the dough in half, shape each half into a disk ¾ to 1 inch thick, wrap each one in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.

Preheat the oven to 350°F with the racks in the upper-middle and lower-middle of the oven. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.

Working with one dough disk at a time, roll the dough between two large sheets of parchment paper into a circle about ¼ inch thick; the diameter should be about 11 inches, but the thickness is more important. Make sure the thickness is even from the center to the edges of the circle. Remove the top sheet of parchment and, with a 3½-inch gingerbread man cookie cutter, cut out as many cookies as possible. Peel away the dough scraps and carefully transfer the cut cookies to the prepared baking sheets, arranging them with about 1 inch space around them (about nine per sheet). Mash the dough scraps together and with the remaining refrigerated dough, roll out and cut as many cookies as possible. Not all of the cookies will fit on the two sheets, necessitating a second round of baking. Make sure the cookie sheets cool before loading them with more cookies to bake.

Bake until the cookies are just set around the edges and slightly puffed, 9 to 11 minutes, rotating the sheets 180 degrees and switching racks midway through the baking. Cool the cookies on the baking sheets for 10 minutes, transfer them to wire racks, and cool completely before decorating.

***Decorate the Cookies.*** Spread the currants on a plate, pick through them to remove any especially large ones, and reserve. In a small bowl, mix ⅓ cup of the tiny currants and the walnuts, and set aside.

With a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, or a handheld electric mixer, beat the confectioners' sugar, egg white, vanilla, a pinch of salt, and 1 teaspoon water on medium-low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Adjust the speed to medium-high and beat until glossy, soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes, stopping to scrape down the bowl as necessary.

On each cooled cookie, spread about ½ teaspoon icing around the midriff, as if making a cummerbund. Working quickly while the icing is still tacky, sprinkle a scant 1 teaspoon of the currant-walnut mixture evenly over each cummerbund, pressing it gently to help it adhere.

Scrape the remaining icing into a small sandwich or ziplock plastic bag and, using your hands or a bench scraper, push it into one lower corner of the bag. Cut off 1/16 inch from the very corner of the bag and pipe two eyes and two thin lines of icing on the arms and legs of each cookie. For the mouth, pipe a ¼-inch dot of icing and press a large currant into it. Allow to dry for about 45 minutes. Serve or store in an airtight container for up to 2 days.

## Gurdats

**Serves** 4 to 6

4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

½ teaspoon fresh lemon juice

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

24 large cremini or white button mushrooms, stems finely chopped, caps left whole

5 garlic cloves, finely chopped

⅔ cup breadcrumbs

½ cup finely chopped fresh parsley

1 shallot, minced

1½ teaspoons minced fresh thyme

¼ cup dry sherry, such as Amontillado

¾ cup finely chopped hot Peppadew peppers (see Cook's Note)

¾ cup coarsely grated Parmesan cheese

3 tablespoons cream cheese, softened

With their fruity, tangy, sweet, and spicy flavor notes, Peppadew peppers (a type of pickled pepper, sold in jars) can be found either hot or mild; the hot variety is preferred here. Blot them dry with paper towels before chopping them.

Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil, set a wire rack in the baking sheet, and coat it with nonstick cooking spray.

In a very large bowl, vigorously whisk together 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, the lemon juice, ½ teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper. Add the mushroom caps and toss gently to coat. Arrange them gill-sides up on the rack and roast until they shrink slightly and fill with liquid, 15 to 18 minutes. Pour off the liquid from the caps, turn them over, and continue roasting until browned and tender, 6 to 10 minutes more. Remove them from the oven and set aside, but leave the oven on.

Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon olive oil, half the garlic, ½ teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper. Add the breadcrumbs and 2 tablespoons of the parsley, toss until the crumbs are lightly moistened, and set aside.

In a skillet over medium heat, warm the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil until shimmering. Add the chopped mushroom stems, shallot, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring until the mixture is softened and browned, about 8 minutes. Add the remaining garlic and cook, stirring until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the sherry and stir, to cook off the alcohol and thicken the mixture slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and let cool to room temperature.

Add ⅓ cup of the breadcrumb mixture, the remaining parsley, the Peppadews, Parmesan, cream cheese, ¼ teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper to the bowl and mix until uniform. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

Turn the mushroom caps gill-side up and scoop a generous 1 tablespoon of filling into each. Dip the mushrooms filled-side down in the remaining breadcrumb mixture to coat the filling and arrange on the rack. Roast until the filling is hot and the crumb topping is crisp and light golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve hot.

## Hand Pies

**Makes** four 6-inch hand pies

6 slices thick-cut bacon

1 large (about 8 ounces) Yukon gold potato, peeled and cut into ½-inch pieces

2 leeks, white and light green parts, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced

1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

4 garlic cloves, finely chopped

1 pound ground beef

3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

⅔ cup low-sodium chicken broth

¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

Pastry for 2 double-crust pies (about 1½ pounds), thawed if frozen

1 egg

Ketchup, grainy mustard, or steak sauce to serve (optional)

In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, fry the bacon, turning it over as necessary, until well-rendered and lightly browned, about 13 minutes. Transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain and reserve.

Measure the rendered fat. Reserve 2½ tablespoons and save the rest for another use or discard it. Return 1½ tablespoons of the fat to the skillet, set over medium-high heat, and allow the fat to warm until shimmering. Add the potato and cook, stirring occasionally, until it begins to soften, about 7 minutes. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon bacon fat and allow it to warm until shimmering. Add the leeks, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the leeks soften, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and set aside.

Wipe out the skillet, return it to medium-high heat, add the beef, and cook, stirring and breaking up any clumps, until it begins to lose its pink color, 4 to 5 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium, add the flour, and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the broth and ¾ teaspoon salt and cook, using a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the skillet to loosen and dissolve any sticking browned bits, until the mixture thickens (and is almost a bit pasty), about 2 minutes. Scrape the mixture into the bowl with the potato mixture, stir to incorporate the two, and set aside to cool until barely warm, about 20 minutes.

Crumble the bacon and add to the bowl with the parsley; stir to incorporate. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary. Cover and set aside in the refrigerator.

Preheat the oven to 375°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick (silicone) liner. Have a small bowl of water handy. If working with homemade pie pastry, divide the dough into quarters. On a lightly floured work surface or parchment paper, roll out a quarter of the dough to make rounds.

Cut the dough into a 10 by 8-inch oval. Place 1 cup of the filling mixture on the bottom third of the dough (a narrow end), leaving about a 1½-inch border around the edges. Moisten the whole perimeter of the dough with water and, using a bench scraper if necessary, fold the top of the oval over the filling to form a half-moon shape. Press the dough around the filling to eliminate any air and to seal. Use the tip of a knife to make a small vent in the shape of an "X" in the center of each pie. Trim any ragged edges and, using a fork, crimp the edges to seal them. Again, using a bench scraper if necessary, transfer the formed pie to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pastry and filling.

In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush the top and sides of each pie with the mixture. Bake until the pies are golden brown and crisp, 40 to 45 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Transfer the pies to a wire rack, cool for 5 to 10 minutes, and serve hot with ketchup, grainy mustard, or steak sauce on the side.

## Hommlet Golden Brown Roasted Turkey with Sausage Stuffing and Drippings

**Serves** 4

#### Stuffing

¾ pound hearty white sandwich bread (8 to 10 slices), cut into ½-inch cubes (about 8 cups, lightly packed)

4 tablespoons unsalted butter

2 teaspoons neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

12 ounces fresh sweet Italian pork sausage, casings removed, if necessary

1 yellow onion, chopped

2 celery stalks, trimmed and chopped

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme

1½ teaspoons minced fresh rosemary

1½ cups low-sodium chicken broth

2 eggs

½ cup chopped fresh parsley

#### Turkey

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 carrot, peeled and coarsely chopped

1 celery stalk, trimmed and coarsely chopped

1 small yellow onion, coarsely chopped

4 large, bone-in, skin-on turkey drumsticks (about 1 pound each)

3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled

#### Gravy

2¼ cups low-sodium chicken broth, plus more as needed

6 slices thick-cut bacon

1 carrot, peeled and finely chopped

1 celery stalk, trimmed and finely chopped

1 yellow onion, finely chopped

1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme

3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

¼ cup finely chopped fresh parsley

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

***Make the Stuffing.*** Preheat the oven to 250°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Spread the bread cubes in an even layer on a large rimmed baking sheet and bake until dry and firm, about 45 minutes, stirring them several times. Transfer the bread cubes into a very large bowl and set aside.

***Meanwhile, Prepare the Turkey.*** Increase oven temperature to 400°F. In a small bowl, mix together 1½ tablespoons salt and 2 teaspoons pepper. Scatter the carrot, celery, and onion in a roasting pan or other stovetop-safe pan into which the drumsticks will fit.

Using your fingers, loosen but do not detach the skin from the drumsticks. Brush about half the melted butter under the skin, sprinkle each with some of the salt and pepper mix, and reposition the skin. Brush the drumsticks' skin with the remaining butter and sprinkle each with some of the remaining salt and pepper mix. Arrange the drumsticks over the vegetables in the pan.

Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each drumstick registers 180° to 185°F, 1 to 1¼ hours. Transfer the drumsticks to a platter, cover loosely with foil, and set aside.

***While the Turkey Roasts, Finish Preparing the Stuffing.*** Grease a broiler-safe 8-inch square (or similarly sized) baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the butter and set aside.

In a skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil until shimmering. Add the sausage and cook, stirring and breaking up clumps into small crumbles, until some of the fat has rendered and the sausage is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to paper towels to drain, leaving the fat in the skillet.

Add the remaining 3 tablespoons butter to the skillet and melt. Add the onion, celery, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until very soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the thyme and rosemary and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add ¾ cup of the broth and stir and scrape the bottom of the skillet to loosen any brown bits. Add this mixture, the sausage, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste to the bowl of bread and toss well to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

In a small bowl, whisk the remaining ¾ cup broth and the eggs until well combined. Add the egg mixture and most of the parsley to the bowl of bread mixture and toss to combine well. Pour the stuffing into the prepared baking dish, spread it into an even layer, cover the dish tightly with foil, and place it on a baking sheet. Put in the oven with the turkey and bake until the stuffing is heated through and the moisture from the mixture is bubbling around the edges of the dish, about 50 minutes.

***Once the Turkey Is Done Roasting, Make the Gravy.*** Use a slotted spoon or skimmer to hold back the solids in the roasting pan and pour the accumulated liquid into a fat separator or measuring cup. Let rest until all the fat rises to the surface, about 10 minutes. If you are using a fat separator, pour the drippings into another container and reserve the fat; if you are using a measuring cup, tilt it and use a wide, shallow soup spoon to skim the fat off the surface and deposit into another container. Reserve the remaining juices.

Set a strainer over a bowl. Place the roasting pan with the roasted vegetables over medium heat and cook undisturbed, until the vegetables begin to brown and stick to the pan, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 1 cup of the chicken broth and, using a wooden spoon, stir and scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen and dissolve the browned bits. Strain the liquid and discard the solids. Add the reserved juices liquid and enough chicken broth to equal 3 cups and set aside.

Wipe out the pan, set it over medium-low heat, and fry the bacon, turning it over as necessary, until well-rendered and lightly browned, about 13 minutes. Transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain, chop it, and reserve. You should have about 3 tablespoons of fat left in the pan.

Set the pan over medium heat and warm until the fat is shimmering. Add the carrot, celery, onion, and thyme and cook, stirring, until the vegetables soften, about 4 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until dark golden and fragrant with a nutty aroma, 3 to 4 minutes. Switch to a whisk and, whisking constantly, gradually add the strained broth mixture. Continuing to whisk, cook until the gravy thickens, about 8 minutes. Add the lemon juice, parsley, bacon, and pepper to taste and whisk to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary.

Once the stuffing is done, if you wish to crisp the skin on the underside of the drumsticks, preheat the broiler. Line a broiler-safe pan or rimmed baking sheet with foil, arrange the drumsticks with the browned sides down, and broil until the skin is browned and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes.

Remove the foil from the stuffing and fluff with a fork. If you'd like to crisp the surface of the stuffing, return the dish to the oven, and broil, checking frequently to prevent burning, until the surface is a shade darker and starting to crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle the stuffing with the remaining parsley. Serve the drumsticks piping hot alongside the stuffing and gravy

## Iron Rations

**Serves** 4

1¼ pounds semifirm or firm cheese, such as Manchego, Asiago Fresco, Gruyère, Comté, Jarlsberg, Gouda, Monterey Jack, or Cheddar, cut into bite-size cubes

10 ounces hard salami; cured sausage, such as hard chorizo, Calabrese, pepperoni, or sopressata; or beef or turkey jerky cut into bite-size pieces

12 pitted dates, dried figs, or dried apricots

1 cup roasted nuts, such as almonds, pecans, cashews, pistachios, or a mixture

4 handfuls wheat crackers

4 whole pieces fresh fruit, such as apples, pears, bananas, oranges, or 4 small bunches grapes

If combining in a container or bag, use dried beef or turkey jerky instead of salami to prevent the mix from becoming too moist due to the high fat content of the meat.

If dining in, divide the cheese, salami, dried fruit, nuts, crackers, and fresh fruit among four plates, and serve. Alternatively, if you're eating on the trail, combine all the ingredients in a large container or bag (or divide evenly among four individual containers) to take with you.

## Kara-Tur Noodles

**Serves** 4

3 tablespoons soy sauce

2½ tablespoons Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry, such as Amontillado

1 tablespoon Asian sesame oil

1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into ½-inch strips

6 ounces dried rice stick noodles (¼ inch wide)

¼ cup plus 2 teaspoons peanut oil or vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed oil

½ cup low-sodium chicken broth

1 teaspoon light brown sugar

½ teaspoon cornstarch

2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped or grated (about 1½ tablespoons)

5 garlic cloves, finely chopped

¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 large yellow onion, halved lengthwise and thickly sliced into slivers

1 large red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into 1-inch squares

1 large celery stalk, cut diagonally into ¾-inch slices

6 scallions, whites thinly sliced and greens cut into 1-inch lengths

A large skillet is important to provide maximum cooking surface for food to spread out. If it is all heaped together, the food will steam instead of achieving the desired browning effect.

Shrimp can be substituted for the chicken. When doing so, buy extra-large (21 to 25 shrimp per pound), and be sure not to overcook them. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes initially, and add them to the vegetable and noodle mixture about halfway through the final heating time, after about 1 minute, so they are only in the mixture until just cooked and heated through, about 1 minute.

In a bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of the rice wine, and 1½ teaspoons of the sesame oil. Add the chicken, toss to coat, cover the bowl, and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes or up to 1 hour.

Meanwhile, put the noodles in a large bowl, cover with boiling water, and stir to separate the noodles. Soak until the noodles are almost tender, about 6 minutes, stirring once halfway through. Drain the noodles, rinse with cold water, and drain again. Return the noodles to the bowl, add 2 teaspoons of the peanut oil, and toss well to coat.

In a small bowl, make the sauce by mixing together the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce, remaining 1½ tablespoons rice wine, remaining 1½ teaspoons sesame oil, the broth, brown sugar, and cornstarch; set aside. In another small bowl, mix together the ginger, garlic, red pepper flakes, and 2 teaspoons of the peanut oil; set aside.

In a very large (14-inch) nonstick skillet over high heat, warm 2 teaspoons peanut oil until shimmering. Add half the chicken in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until the pieces brown on the bottom but are not quite cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a large bowl and set aside. Add another 2 teaspoons peanut oil to the skillet over high heat and warm until the oil is shimmering. Add the remaining chicken, cook as before, and transfer to the bowl when finished.

Add another 2 teaspoons peanut oil to the skillet over high heat and warm until the oil is shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pieces begin to soften and brown at the edges, 2 to 3 minutes; add it to the bowl with the chicken. Add another 2 teaspoons peanut oil to the skillet over high heat and warm until the oil is shimmering. Add the bell pepper and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are barely tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium, clear the center of the pan, add the remaining 2 teaspoons peanut oil, and allow it to warm until shimmering. Add the ginger-garlic mixture and cook, stirring and mashing it, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Whisk the soy sauce mixture to recombine, add it to the skillet, and cook, stirring and scraping the skillet constantly, until thickened, about 1 minute.

Add the chicken mixture, noodles, all of the scallion whites, and most of the scallion greens to the skillet and toss to combine. Cook, stirring constantly, until the noodles are heated through and coated with sauce, about 2 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to a serving platter, sprinkle with the remaining scallion greens, and serve.

## Otik's Skillet-Fried Spiced Potatoes

**Serves** 4

2 tablespoons neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

1 large yellow onion, chopped

Kosher salt

1½ pounds (about 4) Yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed (or peeled if desired), quartered lengthwise, and cut into ¾-inch pieces

1 tablespoon salted butter

Freshly ground black pepper

1 teaspoon sweet paprika

1 teaspoon cayenne

½ teaspoon garlic powder

2 tablespoons minced fresh chives

In a 12- to 14-inch skillet over medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil until shimmering. Add the onion and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium and continue cooking, stirring often, until deep golden and some pieces are starting to brown at the edges, 4 to 6 minutes more. Scrape the onion onto a plate and wipe out the skillet.

Meanwhile, put the potatoes in a large microwave-safe bowl, cover, and microwave until the edges of the potatoes begin to soften, 5 to 7 minutes, shaking the bowl to redistribute the potatoes midway through.

Warm the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the butter in the now-empty skillet over medium-high heat, swirling the pan to combine them. Add the potatoes (leaving behind any liquid accumulated in the bowl) and shake the skillet to coat the potatoes with the fat and evenly distribute them in a single layer, making sure that one side of each piece lies flat on the cooking surface. Cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on the bottom, 6 to 7 minutes. Using a wide spatula, carefully turn the potatoes, taking care not to rip their crusts, and again spread them into a single layer with unbrowned sides lying flat on the cooking surface, and continue cooking, undisturbed, until golden brown on the bottom, about 6 minutes more. Turn the potatoes again and repeat the process until they are tender and well-browned all over, turning one or two more times and adjusting the heat, if necessary, 6 to 12 minutes more. Add ½ teaspoon salt, pepper to taste, the paprika, cayenne, and garlic powder and stir or toss to distribute the seasonings. Add the onion and stir or toss to distribute. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve hot, sprinkling each serving with the chives.

## Pan-Fried Knucklehead Trout

**Serves** 4

¼ cup all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon sweet paprika

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

4 (4-ounce) rainbow trout fillets, skin on, rinsed and dried well

1½ tablespoons olive oil

5 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 lemon, halved

1 shallot, finely chopped

2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Preheat the oven to 250°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.

In a wide, shallow dish such as a pie plate, whisk together the flour, paprika, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper.

Sprinkle the trout fillets lightly with salt and pepper and let rest until they appear moist and glistening, about 5 minutes.

In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter, swirling to combine, until melted and hot. Dredge the fillets in the flour mixture, coat thoroughly, and tap off the excess. Carefully place each fillet, flesh-side down, in the skillet. Cook until the edges are opaque and bottoms are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully turn the fillets over with a spatula and continue to cook until the second side is golden brown and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes more (if the skillet begins to smoke, adjust the heat to medium). Carefully transfer the fillets to an ovenproof serving platter and keep warm in the oven.

Juice one of the lemon halves and cut the other half into four wedges.

Cut the remaining 4 tablespoons butter into four pieces and melt in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallot, stirring constantly until the butter is golden brown and fragrant with a nutty aroma, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the lemon juice, ½ teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste and swirl the pan to combine. Taste and adjust with salt and pepper, if necessary. Pour the browned butter over the fish, sprinkle with the parsley, and serve at once with the lemon wedges.

## Reghed Venison Pot Roast

**Serves** 4

3 pounds beef chuck roast, trimmed of excess fat

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 tablespoons neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

1 large yellow onion, chopped

4 bay leaves

1 teaspoon sweet paprika

1½ tablespoons all-purpose flour

1 tablespoon tomato paste

¾ cup dry white wine

1½ cups low-sodium chicken broth

¾ cup lightly packed dried apricots; ¼ cup finely chopped, ½ cup halved

1 whole head garlic, outermost papery skins removed, top one-quarter of the head cut off to expose the cloves

3 large sprigs fresh thyme

12 ounces carrots, peeled and cut into ¾-inch pieces

12 ounces Yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed or peeled, halved lengthwise, and halves cut into ¾-inch pieces

¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

Dry the beef with paper towels, tie it into a uniform shape with kitchen twine at 2-inch intervals, and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.

In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil until shimmering. Add the beef and cook, undisturbed, until deeply browned on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the beef a quarter turn and continue cooking, until well browned on each of the remaining three sides, about 10 minutes more; adjust the heat if the bottom of the pot threatens to burn. Transfer the beef to a large bowl.

Return the pot to medium-high heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and allow it to warm until shimmering. Add the onion, bay leaves, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally, until the onion begins to soften and releases some liquid, about 4 minutes. Add the paprika and flour and continue to cook, stirring, for 2 minutes more. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more.

Add the wine to the pot and stir and scrape the bottom to loosen and dissolve the browned bits. Add the broth, finely chopped apricots, garlic, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt and stir.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 300°F with a rack in the lower-middle of the oven.

Nestle the beef (and any accumulated juices) into the pot (the liquid should come about halfway up the sides of the meat). Cover the pot, transfer it to the oven, and cook for 1¾ hours. Then add the carrots, potatoes, and halved apricots, nestling them into the liquid. Cover the pot, return to the oven, and continue to cook until the beef is extremely tender (a paring knife should slip easily into the meat) and it registers 200°F on an instant-read thermometer, 2¼ to 2¾ hours more.

Transfer the beef to a cutting board and, using a large slotted spoon, spoon the carrots, potatoes, onion, and apricot halves to a serving platter; tent loosely with foil to keep warm. Pour the accumulated liquid into a fat separator or measuring cup; remove and discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Reserve the garlic. Let the liquid rest until the fat rises to the surface, about 10 minutes. If using a fat separator, pour the liquid into another container; if using a measuring cup, tilt it and use a wide, shallow soup spoon to skim fat off the surface and discard it (the liquid will be thick, and there may not be much fat at the surface.)

Meanwhile, squeeze the cooked garlic cloves from their skins and mash them to a paste with a fork. Stir the garlic and most of the parsley into the defatted liquid. Taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary.

Remove the twine from the beef and cut it against the grain into ½-inch-thick slices (or pull it apart into pieces) and sprinkle it very lightly with salt and pepper. Place the meat on the platter with the vegetables and apricots, pour the gravy over the meat, sprinkle with the remaining parsley, and serve.

## Sembian Honey-Glazed Rothé Ribs

**Serves** 4

½ cup ketchup

½ cup honey

1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

1 tablespoon cider vinegar

2 teaspoons Dijon mustard

1 tablespoon neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

1 yellow onion, finely grated

Kosher salt

5 garlic cloves, finely chopped

2 teaspoons chili powder

1 teaspoon smoked paprika

Pinch of cayenne

4½ to 5 pounds baby back ribs, membranes removed, if desired (see Cook's Note)

Freshly ground black pepper

2 scallions, white and light green parts, thinly sliced, for garnish

On the bone (concave) side of the ribs there is a thin membrane that some people prefer to remove. To do so, slit the corner of the membrane with the tip of a paring knife to loosen it. Grab the loose corner with a paper towel (to improve your grip) and pull it up and off. If it doesn't come off in a single sheet, use the paper-towel trick to help pull off the remaining portion.

Preheat the oven to 325°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack in the sheet.

In a small bowl, whisk together the ketchup, honey, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and mustard until well-blended. Set aside.

In a nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm the oil until shimmering. Add the onion and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the onion appears drier, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic, chili powder, smoked paprika, and cayenne and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the ketchup mixture and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly. Continue to simmer, stirring, until the sauce has thickened slightly and the flavors have blended, about 5 minutes. Set aside off the heat to cool briefly; the mixture will thicken as it cools.

Sprinkle both sides of the ribs generously with salt and pepper. Brush about ⅓ cup of the sauce on the bone side, turn the ribs bone-side down, and brush the meaty sides with about ⅔ cup of the remaining sauce. Keeping the ribs bone-side down, roast until the meat is extremely tender (a paring knife should slip easily into the meat) and the meat between the bones in the middle of the racks registers about 205°F on an instant-read thermometer, 2½ to 3 hours; check after 2 hours and cover with foil if the top is getting too dark.

Adjust the oven temperature to 425°F. Brush the remaining ¼ cup sauce on the exposed (meaty) sides of the racks and continue to roast until the sauce heats through but remains sticky, 8 to 10 minutes.

Transfer the ribs to a cutting board and cut as desired. Transfer the cut ribs to a platter, sprinkle with the scallions, and serve hot.

## Sword Coast Seafood Bouillabaisse

**Serves** 4 to 6

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling

1 large yellow onion, chopped

2 bay leaves

Kosher salt

1 large leek, white and light green parts, halved lengthwise and cut into 1-inch pieces

5 garlic cloves; 4 finely chopped, 1 left whole

1½ teaspoons ground fennel seed

½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more if needed

¼ teaspoon crushed saffron threads (optional)

1 tablespoon tomato paste

½ cup dry white wine

2 cups fish or seafood stock

1 (14½-ounce) can diced tomatoes

4 strips orange zest, about 4 inches long by 1 inch wide

2 tablespoons anise-flavored liqueur, such as pastis or Pernod

1½ pounds littleneck clams, rinsed and scrubbed well, any gaping clams discarded

1½ pounds firm, meaty white fish fillets (such as monkfish, swordfish, hake, haddock, cod, halibut, or tilapia), skinned, if necessary, and cut into 1½-inch chunks

Freshly ground black pepper

1½ pounds mussels, debearded if necessary, rinsed and scrubbed, any gaping mussels discarded

Thick slices of baguette, pain au levain, or hearty French or Italian bread, toasted, for serving

¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

You can substitute some shelled, deveined extra-large shrimp (21 to 25 shrimp per pound) or sea scallops for a portion of the fish, keeping in mind that they will probably cook faster than some of the meatier types of fish.

In a large Dutch oven over medium heat, warm the oil until shimmering. Add the onion, bay leaves, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the leek, chopped garlic, fennel seed, red pepper flakes, and saffron (if using) and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute more. Add the wine, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Simmer, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot, for about 1 minute more. Add the fish stock, tomatoes, and orange zest and return to a simmer. Adjust the heat to medium-low and simmer to blend flavors, about 20 minutes more. Pick out and discard the bay leaves and orange zest strips, if desired. Add the anise liqueur and stir to combine.

Add the clams to the pot, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Adjust the heat to medium, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper and submerge it in the liquid in the pot, arranging it in as much of a single layer as possible around the clams. Add the mussels, replace the cover, and cook until the clams and mussels open (when serving, discard any that don't) and the fish is fully opaque and firm when gently squeezed (cooking time will depend on the type and thickness of the fish), 8 to 14 minutes more. Set aside off the heat to rest for 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, cut the remaining clove of garlic in half and swipe over the toasts, then drizzle with olive oil.

Add most of the parsley to the stew and stir gently to incorporate but try not to break up the fish too much. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve at once, with the toasts, in warmed shallow soup plates, drizzling each serving with some olive oil and sprinkling with the remaining parsley.

## Tavern Steak

**Serves** 4

#### Dill-Yogurt Sauce

¾ cup plain Greek yogurt

2 tablespoons dill pickle relish

2 tablespoons minced shallot

¼ cup finely chopped fresh dill

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

#### Black Olive and Fig Sauce

6 dried figs, stemmed and quartered

1 cup pitted Niçoise or Kalamata olives, rinsed and drained

1½ tablespoons capers, rinsed, drained, and squeezed dry

2 garlic cloves, finely chopped

1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme

1½ teaspoons fresh lemon juice

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt (optional)

3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

#### Tavern Steaks

2 teaspoons olive oil

1 small yellow onion, finely chopped

Kosher salt

7 garlic cloves, finely chopped

1½ tablespoons finely chopped fresh thyme

12 ounces ground lamb

12 ounces ground beef chuck

Freshly ground black pepper

If you choose to serve the tavern steaks with bread, brioche buns or English muffins are excellent options, particularly if you grill them, cut-sides down, while the cooked tavern steaks rest.

***Make the Dill-Yogurt Sauce.*** In a small bowl, whisk together the yogurt, relish, shallot, dill, ½ teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Cover and refrigerate until needed.

***Make the Olive and Fig Sauce.*** In a bowl, cover the figs with 1 cup boiling water and set aside to soften, about 15 minutes. Reserving about ⅓ cup of the soaking water, drain the figs, dry, and finely chop.

In a food processor, combine the olives, capers, garlic, thyme, and lemon juice. Process until finely chopped. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil. Stop to scrape down the sides of the work bowl and continue pulsing or processing to a desired consistency. Scrape the mixture into a bowl, add the figs, stir, and set aside to blend the flavors, about 15 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning by adding salt to taste; adjust the consistency by adding some of the reserved fig soaking liquid, about 1 tablespoon at a time, if necessary. Set the sauce and parsley aside at room temperature

***Make the Steaks.*** In a small skillet over medium heat, warm the oil until shimmering. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.

In a large bowl, break up the ground lamb and beef into rough chunks. Add the onion mixture, 1½ teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and toss lightly with your hands to distribute the seasonings. Divide the mixture into four 6-ounce portions and, with a light hand, gently form them into patties roughly 4 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick. Press a divot into the top of each patty, if desired. Cover and refrigerate until you are ready to grill.

Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill on high for 15 minutes. Clean and oil the grill grate. Grill the patties until grill-marked on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Flip the patties and continue grilling for 3 minutes, until the meat is medium-rare (125° to 130°F on an instant-read thermometer), or for about 6 minutes for medium (135° to 140°F), or for 9 to 10 minutes for well (155° to 160°F).

Transfer the patties to a plate, cover loosely with foil, and let rest for about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, stir the parsley into the olive-fig sauce. Serve the steaks hot with the sauces passed at the table.

## Traveler's Stew

**Serves** 6

¼ cup all-purpose flour

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1½ pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch pieces

1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more as needed

1 cup dark beer

4 cups low-sodium beef broth

1 teaspoon sweet paprika

1 large yellow onion, chopped

2 carrots, peeled and cut into ½-inch rounds

3 Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces

¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

Most stews are made with broth and a small amount of wine, but this one utilizes dark beer. The beer infuses the stew with an earthy and faintly malty flavor.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and several grinds of pepper. Add the beef and toss to coat well.

Warm the oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add one-third to half of the beef—do not crowd—and cook for about 5 minutes, turning to brown all sides evenly. Transfer the browned beef to a plate and repeat to brown the remaining beef, adding more oil, if needed, between batches.

Pour the beer into the pot and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits. Return the browned beef to the pot and add the broth and paprika. Adjust the heat to low, cover, and cook at a simmer until the meat is very tender, 1½ to 2 hours.

Add the onion, carrots, and potatoes to the pot, and continue to simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper. Serve hot.

## Trolltide Candied Apples

**Makes** 4 apples

4 apples, scrubbed clean and dried well

1¼ cups sugar

3 tablespoons light corn syrup

½ teaspoon red food coloring, plus more as needed (optional)

¼ cup water

¼ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

For best results, use hard, tart apples such as Honeycrisp or Granny Smith. Supermarket apples often have a coating to help protect them, so make sure to scrub your apples well and dry them thoroughly.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Working one at a time, spear each apple through the core end and most of the way through the fruit with a Popsicle stick or chopstick. Place the apples on the baking sheet.

In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup, food coloring (if using), and water and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Adjust the heat to medium and simmer, swirling the pan occasionally, until the mixture registers between 300° and 310°F on an instant-read, candy, or deep-fry thermometer, 15 to 18 minutes. Add the vanilla near the end of that time.

Working quickly, take the pan off the heat and tilt it to pool the candy mixture on one side. Dip the apples, one at a time, twirling them to coat entirely with the candy mixture. Hold each apple straight over the pot and allow the excess candy mixture to drip off. Return the apples to the parchment paper–lined baking sheet.

Allow the apples to cool, set, and dry for 20 minutes before serving.

## Vedbread

**Makes** 14 buns

#### Filling

12 ounces cremini mushrooms, coarsely chopped (see Cook's Note)

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

2 shallots, finely chopped

Kosher salt

1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme

¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Freshly ground black pepper

#### Dough

2¼ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling

1 tablespoon baking powder

1 teaspoon sugar

½ teaspoon kosher salt

6 ounces Gruyère cheese, coarsely grated

¾ cup buttermilk, cold

6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled

1 egg

Truffle oil for brushing (optional)

You can use an equal quantity of stemmed, coarsely chopped shiitake mushrooms in place of the creminis.

***Make the Filling.*** In a food processor, pulse the mushrooms to finely chop, using about eight 1-second pulses.

In a skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until they begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and ¼ teaspoon salt, adjust the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms release their liquid and it evaporates fully, 9 to 12 minutes. Add the thyme and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat, add the Parmesan, and stir to mix. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Spread the mixture on a plate and cool to room temperature.

Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick (silicone) liner.

***Make the Dough.*** In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Add the grated Gruyère and whisk to combine.

In a small bowl, whisk the buttermilk and melted butter to combine (the butter will clump, which is fine). Add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture. With a sturdy spoon, stir to form a sticky, chunky dough. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and knead until it holds together and is mostly smooth; do not overknead. Lift the dough and sprinkle more flour underneath it, if necessary, as well as over the surface. Roll or pat the dough into a roughly 12 by 18-inch rectangle; brush any excess flour off the surface.

Spread the cooled mushroom filling evenly over the entire surface of the dough; it will be a very thin, patchy layer. With the long side facing you, roll the dough into a very tight, even, compact cylinder. Pinch the seam along the entire length of the cylinder to fasten. Using a serrated knife in a sawing motion, trim off the very ends of the cylinder and discard. Cut the cylinder into 1¼-inch pieces (you should have about fourteen) and arrange them cut-sides up on the baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.

In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush the top and sides of each bun with the mixture. Bake until the buns are golden brown, about 18 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through.

Cool the buns on the pan for about 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool. Brush with a light coating of truffle oil (if using). Serve warm or at room temperature. Store leftover buns in an airtight container at room temperature and reheat them in a preheated 300°F oven for about 8 minutes before serving.

## Yawning Portal Buttermilk Biscuits

**Makes** about 9 biscuits

12 tablespoons unsalted butter; 2 tablespoons at room temperature, 10 tablespoons chilled

3½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting

1½ teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon baking soda

1¼ teaspoons kosher salt

1½ teaspoons sugar

1⅔ cups buttermilk

Preheat the oven to 450°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Grease an 8-inch square baking pan (preferably metal) with 1 tablespoon of the room-temperature butter, making sure to grease the corners and edges of the pan.

Coarsely cut the 10 tablespoons chilled butter into ½-inch pieces and refrigerate until needed.

In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar. Add the chilled butter, toss the pieces in the dry mixture to coat them, and use your fingertips to break up and press the butter into pea-size pieces. Add the buttermilk and, with a sturdy spoon, stir to form a sticky dough with no pockets of dry ingredients remaining. Coat a flexible spatula with nonstick cooking spray and scrape the dough into the greased baking pan. Flour your hands generously and pat the dough into an even layer, making sure to push it into the corners and to the edges. Clean and coat the spatula again, if necessary, and score the dough into nine equal squares (two cuts in each direction, dividing the dough into three rows in each direction), reaching to the bottom of the pan as you score.

Bake until the biscuits are deep golden brown on top, about 30 minutes, rotating the pan 180 degrees halfway through the baking time.

Cool the biscuits in the pan for 5 minutes. Remove the biscuits from the pan and set them on a wire rack. Cut the remaining 1 tablespoon room-temperature butter into ½-inch pieces, put them on the surface of the biscuits, wait a moment for them to begin melting, and use a brush or the spatula to spread evenly over the biscuits. Cool the biscuits for about 12 minutes more, pull them apart, and serve warm.

## Beluir Poached Salmon

**Makes** about 2 cups

**Serves** 4 to 6

8 ounces salmon fillet, skin left on and any pinbones removed

8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature

1½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more as needed

½ teaspoon paprika

1 pinch cayenne pepper

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

6 tablespoons minced shallots

3 ounces cold-smoked Nova Scotia-style salmon, finely chopped

¼ cup minced fresh chives

Crostini or thinly sliced baguette for serving

Capers for serving (see Cook's Note)

If you'd like to dampen the capers' saltiness, rinse them under cold running water and blot dry before serving.

The salmon can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days.

Fill a wide pot with about 3 inches of water, set a steamer basket into the pot (the water should not touch the steamer), cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the salmon fillet, skin-side down, cover, and steam until just slightly translucent at the center, 6 to 9 minutes, depending on its thickness (the salmon will finish cooking as it cools). Transfer the salmon to a plate and set aside to cool to room temperature. When ready to handle, remove and discard the skin and break the flesh into large flakes.

In a food processor, combine the cream cheese, lemon juice, paprika, cayenne, and ½ teaspoon salt and season with black pepper. Process until smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides of the work bowl, using a flexible spatula as necessary. Add about half the steamed salmon and process until well combined, again stopping to scrape down the sides of the work bowl as necessary. Scrape the mixture into a medium bowl, add the remaining steamed salmon, the shallots, smoked salmon, and chives. Using the spatula, fold the mixture until well combined. Adjust the seasoning with additional lemon juice, salt, and pepper, if necessary. Cover and refrigerate to let the flavors blend, about 30 minutes.

When ready to serve, let rest at room temperature for a few minutes so it loses its chill, then pass crostini and capers alongside.

## Black Lotus Root

**Serves** 6 as a snack

12 ounces fresh lotus root, peeled and sliced ¼ inch thick

Kosher salt

⅔ cup unseasoned rice vinegar

⅔ cup water

3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon granulated sugar

1½ tablespoons butterfly pea powder (see Cook's Note)

1 medium shallot, very thinly sliced

Butterfly pea powder is made from the butterfly pea plant and is available online and at some natural food stores with a good selection of herbs and spices. In combination with an acidic ingredient, such as the rice vinegar, it produces a vivid purple tint.

In a large bowl, soak the sliced lotus in water to cover for about 15 minutes. Drain the lotus and set aside. Refill the bowl with ice water.

Meanwhile, fill a medium saucepan with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add ½ teaspoon salt and the lotus, cover, and cook until just tender-crisp, about 1½ minutes (the water won't return to a full boil). Drain the lotus and immediately add to the ice water to stop the cooking. Drain again and set aside.

Set the saucepan over medium-high heat; add the vinegar, ⅔ cup water, and sugar; and bring to a bare simmer, whisking to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat, add the butterfly pea powder and ¼ teaspoon salt, and whisk to combine, taking care to break up any small clumps of powder. Add the blanched lotus and the shallot, submerging them in the liquid as much as possible, and set aside to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

Transfer the contents of the saucepan to a container, taking care to submerge the lotus as much as possible. Cover and refrigerate until the lotus is a deep shade of purple, at least 24 hours or up to 5 days. Serve cold.

## Blood of Vol

**Serves** 4

7 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

4 ounces thinly sliced salami or other cured sausage, cut into thin strips

1 large yellow onion, chopped

5 large red bell peppers, cored, seeded, and thinly sliced

1 bay leaf

Kosher salt

4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced

1½ teaspoons paprika

1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme

½ teaspoon red pepper flakes

One 14½-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, drained and crushed by hand into small pieces, with ¼ cup juices reserved

1 teaspoon sherry vinegar

⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley

Freshly ground black pepper

8 eggs

Line a plate with paper towels.

In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm 3 tablespoons of the olive oil until shimmering. Add the salami and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the salami to the prepared plate and set aside, leaving the oil in the skillet. Add the onion, bell peppers, bay leaf, and 1 teaspoon salt to the skillet. Adjust the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring frequently, until the bell peppers are tender-crisp, about 20 minutes. Clear the center of the skillet, add 1½ tablespoons olive oil, and let warm for a moment. Add the garlic, paprika, thyme, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring just those aromatics, until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Add the cooked salami and tomatoes with the reserved juices and stir to incorporate along with the aromatics into the bell peppers. Adjust the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the flavors meld, about 5 minutes longer.

Remove the bay leaf; add the vinegar, most of the parsley, and ½ teaspoon salt; season with pepper; and stir to blend. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Transfer the mixture to a serving dish and set aside. Wipe out the skillet with paper towels.

In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, 1½ tablespoons olive oil, ¾ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper and whisk until uniformly yellow.

Adjust the heat to medium, add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet, and warm until shimmering. Add the egg mixture and cook, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Using a flexible heatproof spatula, scramble the eggs by scraping along the bottom and sides of the skillet and folding them in large strokes until clumped in large curds and just slightly wet, about 2 minutes longer. Immediately scrape the eggs over the pepper mixture in the serving dish. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley before serving.

## Breaded Bird Cutlets

**Serves** 4

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

½ cup all-purpose flour

2 eggs

1 tablespoon water

4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 7 ounces each), tenderloins removed, trimmed of fat

⅓ cup neutral oil

⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil

3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold

¼ cup minced shallot

2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme

½ cup dry vermouth or dry white wine

1 cup low-sodium chicken broth

½ lemon, thinly sliced

3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 200°F. Place a wire rack on a large-rimmed baking sheet and set aside.

In a small bowl, combine 2½ teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper, stir to incorporate, and set aside.

Put the flour in a wide, shallow dish, such as a pie plate. In another wide, shallow dish, beat the eggs with the water. Set both dishes aside.

On a work surface, using a sharp knife, cut each chicken breast in half horizontally to make eight cutlets. Cover them with plastic wrap and use a meat pounder or the bottom of a small skillet to pound the thicker ends so the cutlets have an even thickness of ¼ to ½ inch. Remove the plastic, sprinkle the cutlets evenly with the salt-pepper mixture, and set aside to rest for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, combine the neutral oil and olive oil and warm until shimmering.

Dredge two cutlets in the flour on both sides and shake off the excess. Dip in the beaten egg mixture, allowing the excess to drip into the dish. Gently add the cutlets to the oil and cook until golden brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes (there should be active, but not violent, bubbling at the edges of the cutlets). Carefully flip them and cook until the second side is golden brown, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer the cutlets to the prepared wire rack, and put in the oven to keep warm. Repeat to cook the remaining cutlets, adjusting the heat if necessary to avoid burning (do not discard the remaining flour).

Discard the oil in the skillet, then carefully wipe it out with paper towels. Set the skillet over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of the butter, and let melt, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan. Add the shallot, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the vermouth, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a strong simmer. Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen and dissolve the caramelized bits, until the vermouth is reduced by almost half, about 2½ minutes. Add the chicken broth, lemon slices, and any juices accumulated from the rested cutlets. Return the mixture to a strong simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until again reduced by about almost half, about 3 minutes longer.

Meanwhile, cut the remaining 2 tablespoons butter into small cubes, add to the flour, and toss to coat. Remove the skillet from the heat, add the coated butter and ¼ teaspoon salt, season with pepper, and whisk to melt and incorporate the butter. Add the parsley and whisk to incorporate. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Arrange the cutlets on a serving platter and spoon the sauce and lemon slices over them before serving.

## Green Dragon Blackbread Muffins

**Makes** 12 muffins

1 cup all-purpose flour

½ cup dark rye flour

½ cup medium-grind cornmeal (preferably stone-ground)

2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder (preferably Dutch-process)

1½ teaspoons baking soda

¾ teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon baking powder

¼ cup neutral oil

4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus butter at room temperature for serving

⅓ cup unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap)

¼ cup packed dark brown sugar

1 egg

¾ cup buttermilk

¾ cup currants or raisins (optional)

Choose a nonstick muffin tin with a gold-tone, or medium-grey finish (or other medium tone). These produce nicely browned baked goods, neither too dark (as is often the case with heavily sweetened batters in very dark bakeware), nor too light.

Baking soda, the primary leavener here, starts to react with the acidic ingredients in the batter on contact. Work quickly to fill the muffin tin, and get it into the oven at once so you don't lose too much leavening oomph.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 400°F. Coat a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray, or line with paper liners, and set aside.

In a large bowl, combine both flours, the cornmeal, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and baking powder and whisk to incorporate. In a medium bowl, combine the neutral oil, melted butter, molasses, and brown sugar and whisk, to break up any sugar lumps, until uniform. Add the egg and buttermilk and whisk until uniform. Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture and, using a flexible spatula, fold until they're incorporated into a batter with no dry patches (do not overmix). Fold in the currants (if using). Working quickly, using a large spoon or portion scoop, evenly divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups.

Bake the muffins until a toothpick inserted in the center of one or two comes out clean, about 15 minutes, rotating the muffin tin halfway through (do not overbake). Let the muffins cool in the tin for about 12 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool further, if desired. Serve with room-temperature butter.

## Halfling Game Birds

**Serves** 4

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest

2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary

2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme

2 Cornish game hens (about 2 pounds each)

Olive oil spray

Set a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet and set aside.

In a small bowl, combine 1½ tablespoons salt, 1½ teaspoons pepper, the lemon zest, rosemary, and thyme; stir to incorporate; and set aside.

On a work surface, using kitchen or poultry shears, cut through both sides of, and remove, a Cornish hen's backbone. Repeat with the second hen. Working one at a time, turn the hens so they're breast-side up and then flatten with one of your hands. Using a chef's knife, cut through the breastbone to halve each hen.

Pat the hens dry with paper towels and then, working with one half hen at a time, gently shimmy a finger between the skin and the meat, loosening but not detaching the skin. Rub about one-fourth of the seasoning mixture under the skin of each half, then sprinkle about ½ teaspoon salt all over the skin of each half. Tuck the wing tips behind the breasts and arrange the halves skin-side up on the prepared rack. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.

With racks in the upper-middle and lower-middle positions, place a second rimmed baking sheet on the lower rack, and preheat the oven to 500°F.

When the oven is ready, remove the hens from the refrigerator. Coat the skins with olive oil spray and sprinkle each hen half with about ¼ teaspoon pepper. Carefully arrange the hens, skin-side down, on the preheated baking sheet and roast for 10 minutes. Remove the hens from the oven and preheat the broiler. Flip the hens skin-side up, set the baking sheet on the upper rack, and broil the hens until well browned and an instant-read thermometer registers 160°F when inserted into the thickest part of a breast, and 175°F in the thickest part of a thigh, 6 to 9 minutes, rotating the sheet as necessary for even browning. Transfer the hen halves to a platter or individual plates. Serve immediately.

## Ornabra

**Serves** 6

8 medium carrots, peeled

3½ pounds boneless lamb shoulder roast (see Cook's Note), trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1½-inch chunks

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

About 1½ tablespoons neutral oil

2 large onions, chopped

3 bay leaves

1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary or thyme, or a combination

1 tablespoon tomato paste

2 cups low-sodium chicken broth

2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into ¾-inch pieces

1 teaspoon cider vinegar

½ cup chopped fresh parsley

If you can't find boneless lamb shoulder roast, you can substitute lamb shoulder blade chops and remove the bones. But in that case, buy extra.

With a rack in the lower-middle position, preheat the oven to 325°F.

Finely chop two of the carrots and set aside. Cut the remaining six carrots into 1-inch chunks and set aside separately.

In a medium bowl, toss the lamb with 1½ teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and the flour to coat.

In a large, ovenproof sauté pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm 2 teaspoons of the neutral oil until shimmering. Add a third of the lamb (the pieces should be close together in a single layer, but not touching; do not crowd the pan) and cook, undisturbed, until deeply browned on the bottom, about 3½ minutes. Flip the pieces and cook, undisturbed, until the second side is deeply browned, about 3½ minutes longer. Transfer the lamb to a large bowl. Repeat to brown the remaining lamb in another one or two batches (warming more neutral oil for each batch and adjusting the heat as necessary to avoid scorching).

Spoon off all but 1 tablespoon of fat. Set the pan over medium heat, add the finely chopped carrots, onions, bay leaves, rosemary, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, occasionally stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen any caramelized bits, until the vegetables are softened and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Make a small clearing in the center, add the tomato paste, and cook, stirring, until fragrant and a bit darker, about 1½ minutes. Add the chicken broth, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a strong simmer, again scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen and dissolve any additional caramelized bits. Add the browned lamb with the accumulated juices and stir to combine, submerging the lamb as much as possible. Return to a strong simmer.

Cover the pan, transfer to the oven, and bake for 1½ hours. Add ½ teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon pepper, the carrot chunks, and potatoes, submerging them in the liquid as best you can. Replace the cover and continue to bake until the lamb and vegetables are very tender, 40 to 60 minutes longer. If the stew is more liquidy than you'd like, mash some of the potatoes against the side of the pot and stir them into the cooking liquid to thicken it.

Remove the bay leaves, add the vinegar, and stir to mix. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Add most of the parsley and stir to combine. Serve immediately, sprinkling each portion with the remaining parsley.

## Thrakel-Seared Beef in Red Sauce

**Serves** 4

1 pound flank steak, trimmed of fat

2 tablespoons Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry

1 tablespoon soy sauce

2½ teaspoons cornstarch

½ teaspoon granulated sugar

2 tablespoons low-sodium chicken broth or water

2 teaspoons unseasoned rice vinegar

2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil

3 tablespoons ketchup

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger

1 tablespoon pressed or grated garlic

6 scallions, trimmed, white parts minced and green parts cut into ½-inch pieces

3 tablespoons neutral oil

1 pound plum tomatoes, cored, halved lengthwise, seeded, and halves cut lengthwise into thirds (see Cook's Note)

1 medium yellow onion, halved from pole to pole and sliced lengthwise

You can substitute one 14 ½-ounce can diced tomatoes, drained, for the plum tomatoes, and use 2 tablespoons of their liquid instead of the broth.

Serve this with hot freshly cooked rice—brown or white.

Cut the flank steak against the grain into ½-inch-thick slices, each strip cut crosswise into thirds.

In a medium bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of the rice wine, the soy sauce, 2 teaspoons of the cornstarch, and the sugar and whisk to blend. Add the beef, stir to coat, and let rest at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the remaining 1 tablespoon rice wine, remaining ½ teaspoon cornstarch, the chicken broth, rice vinegar, and sesame oil and stir to blend. Add the ketchup, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper; mix until well blended; and set aside. In another small bowl, combine the ginger, garlic, scallion whites, and 2 teaspoons of the neutral oil; stir to mix; and set aside.

In a large nonstick skillet over high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil until shimmering. Swirl the skillet to coat the bottom with oil, add half the beef in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned on the bottom, about 1 minute. Flip the beef, continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until brown on both sides, about 1 minute longer. Transfer to a large bowl, and set aside. Add another 1 tablespoon neutral oil to the skillet and repeat to cook the remaining beef. Transfer to the bowl.

Adjust the heat to medium-high, add the remaining 1 teaspoon of neutral oil to the skillet, and warm until shimmering. Swirl the skillet to coat the bottom with oil, add the tomatoes, toss to coat, and arrange in a single layer. Cook, undisturbed, until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Transfer half the tomatoes to the bowl with the beef. Add the onion to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 1½ minutes. Add the scallion greens and cook, stirring occasionally, until they start to wilt, about 1½ minutes longer. Adjust the heat to medium, clear the center of the pan, add the ginger-garlic mixture, and cook, stirring and mashing, until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Whisk the ketchup mixture to recombine, add to the skillet, and cook, stirring constantly until thickened, about 45 seconds. Return the beef and cooked tomatoes to the pan and cook, stirring constantly, until heated through and coated with sauce, about 1 minute longer. Serve immediately.

## Vada's Vanilla Buns

**Makes** 12 buns

1½ cups unsweetened flaked coconut

2½ cups bread flour, plus extra to dust the work surface

½ cup water, plus 1 tablespoon

3 vanilla beans

½ cup milk (not skim)

2 eggs

1 packet (2¼ teaspoons) instant or Rapid Rise yeast

¼ cup granulated sugar

Kosher salt

3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces and softened

When toasting the coconut, keep it moving in the skillet, and keep a close eye on it because it browns quickly once it begins and can burn easily. As soon as the coconut is browned to your liking, get it out of the hot skillet immediately.

The dough is quite soft and sticky, so a bowl scraper, ideally a flexible one, is very helpful for scraping it out of the mixer bowl (and off the dough hook) and forming the ball on the work surface prior to the first rise.

In a medium skillet over medium heat, toast the coconut, stirring constantly, until many of the flakes are dark golden brown (some flakes will remain white, so the quantity will appear to be spotty brown), about 4 minutes. Immediately scrape the coconut into the bowl of a food processor, and set aside to cool to room temperature, at least 10 minutes. Pulse until it's about the texture of whole flax seeds (a little smaller than sunflower seeds), about five 2-second pulses, and set aside.

Meanwhile, carefully wipe out the still-hot skillet. In the skillet, off heat, whisk ¼ cup of the flour and ½ cup of the water until it forms a smooth, thick paste (with help from the residual heat in the skillet) about the texture of mashed potatoes, about 1 minute. Immediately scrape the paste into the bowl of a stand mixer, and set aside to cool until tepid, about 8 minutes.

Meanwhile, with a paring knife, halve the vanilla beans lengthwise and scrape the seeds from all six halves. Collect the seeds in a small dish, cover, and set aside.

Add the milk to the flour paste and whisk until smooth. Add one egg and whisk to incorporate it. Add the remaining 2¼ cups flour and the yeast. Fit the bowl and the dough hook to the stand mixer and mix on low speed for 1 minute. Adjust the speed to medium-low and continue mixing until the flour is incorporated and the resulting mass is cohesive, about 30 seconds longer. Turn off the mixer and rest the dough for 15 minutes. Add the sugar and 1½ teaspoons salt and knead on medium-low speed for 5 minutes, until the dough appears smoother. With the mixer running, add one piece of the butter and continue mixing until it is incorporated fully into the dough, about 30 seconds, before adding the next. Repeat to add and incorporate the remaining three pieces of butter, adding the vanilla seeds along with the last piece. Continue to mix on medium-low speed 5 minutes longer, adding the coconut midway through that time and stopping when needed to scrape down the dough hook and sides of the bowl (the dough will be quite soft and sticky).

Flour a work surface very lightly, scrape the dough from the bowl to the surface, and knead it briefly to form a ball. Lightly oil a medium bowl, add the dough, and turn it to coat very lightly with the oil. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and set aside until the dough has become puffy and its volume has increased by three-fourths or doubled, about 1 hour.

Oil a 9-inch round cake pan, line the bottom with parchment paper, and oil the parchment paper. Transfer the dough to the work surface, gently deflate it, and press and stretch it into a 10 by 12-inch rectangle with a short side facing you. Cut the dough lengthwise into 4 equal strips and cut each strip crosswise into 3 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, stretch and press the dough gently to form an 8 by 2-inch strip. Starting on a short side, roll the strip to form a snug cylinder. Arrange the shaped buns seam-side down in the prepared pan, placing 10 buns around the edge of the pan, pointing inward, and the remaining 2 buns in the center. Cover the pan with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and set aside until the buns appear puffy and their volume has increased by about three-fourths or doubled, about 1 hour.

When ready to bake, with a rack in the lowest position, preheat the oven to 375°F. In a small bowl, beat the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon water. Gently brush the tops of the buns with the egg wash (take care not to deflate the dough) and bake until deep golden brown, 20 to 24 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Set the pan on a cooling rack and cool for about 15 minutes. Gently loosen the edges of the buns with your fingers and gently pry them out of the pan. Cool the buns until just warm or room temperature, remove the parchment from the bottom of the buns if necessary, and serve. Leftover buns can be wrapped tightly and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days.

## Barovian Garlic Bread

**Makes** 12 knots

4 tablespoons unsalted butter

2 tablespoons pressed or grated garlic

1½ teaspoons water

Kosher salt

All-purpose flour for dusting

1 pound pizza dough, at room temperature

With a rack in the upper-middle position, preheat the oven to 475°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat, place a wire rack on the baking sheet, and set aside.

In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter; add the garlic and water; and cook, stirring frequently, until the garlic is pale gold and very fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and stir to melt. Remove the pan from the heat and let the mixture rest to infuse with the garlic flavor, about 10 minutes.

Set a fine-mesh strainer over a small, microwave-safe bowl and strain the garlic butter, pressing on the solids to squeeze out as much butter as possible. Stir ½ teaspoon salt into the butter and set aside.

Generously dust a work surface with flour. Put the pizza dough on the surface and shape into a 12-inch log. Using a bench knife, cut the log crosswise into quarters and then cut each quarter into thirds. Roll each of the twelve dough pieces into an 8- to 9-inch rope and tie each rope into a simple knot. Tuck the ends underneath the knot. Place the knots, about 2 inches apart, on the prepared rack.

Bake the knots until they are just set, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush with half the garlic butter. Rotate the baking sheet 180 degrees from its original position, return to the oven, and continue baking until the knots are lightly browned on the top, about 7 minutes longer. (Meanwhile, if the remaining garlic butter has hardened, microwave it for about 15 seconds at partial power to melt.) Remove the knots from the oven and immediately brush them with the remaining garlic butter. Sprinkle lightly with salt, let cool for 5 minutes, and then serve warm.

## Fig Cakes

**Makes** 6 cakes

¾ cup slivered almonds, lightly toasted (see Cook's Note, this page) and cooled

8 ounces dried figs, quartered

1½ teaspoons finely grated lemon zest

¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon

¾ teaspoon ground anise

1 small pinch kosher salt

3 tablespoons brandy or cognac

⅓ cup sesame seeds, lightly toasted (see Cook's Note, this page) and cooled

In a food processor, pulse the almonds until fine but not pasty, about five 2-second pulses. Scrape the ground nuts into a medium bowl. Add the figs, lemon zest, cinnamon, anise, salt, and brandy to the food processor and process until very finely chopped and well blended, about 20 seconds, stopping to scrape down the sides as necessary. Add the ground almonds and pulse several times to incorporate them, about four 2-second pulses. Scrape the mixture into the medium bowl. Place the sesame seeds in a wide, shallow bowl.

Roll scant ¼-cup portions of the mixture into six balls, gently pressing as you roll to help them cohere. Press gently with your fingers to flatten and shape the balls into ovals about 3 inches long, 2 inches wide, and ½ inch thick. Working with one oval at a time, place it in the sesame seeds, pressing gently to help the seeds adhere to the bottom. Place the cakes, sesame-side up, on a plate. Let rest to firm up and dry out slightly, for 1 hour before serving.

## Green Onion Pancakes

**Serves** 3 to 4 as an appetizer

⅓ cup all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons onion powder

½ teaspoon baking powder

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

⅓ cup crème fraîche (see Cook's Note)

1½ tablespoons whole milk or half-and-half, plus more as needed

1 egg, beaten

¼ cup very cold water, plus more as needed

1½ teaspoons soy sauce

1½ tablespoons neutral oil

½ cup finely shredded green cabbage, massaged with your hands to soften

1 small carrot, peeled and grated on the large holes of a box grater

16 scallions, trimmed, whites thinly sliced and greens cut into 2-inch lengths

You can substitute sour cream or plain Greek yogurt for the crème fraîche.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 250°F. Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet and set aside.

In a small bowl, combine the flour, onion powder, baking powder, and 1½ teaspoons salt; season with pepper; whisk to incorporate; and set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the crème fraîche and milk and whisk to a thick, barely pourable consistency, adding more milk, about 1 teaspoon at a time, as needed. Using a flexible spatula, scrape the mixture into a small serving dish and put in the refrigerator.

In the medium bowl, combine the egg, water, soy sauce, and 1½ teaspoons of the neutral oil and whisk until well blended. Add the flour mixture and whisk to form a loose, smooth batter with the consistency of applesauce, adding more water by the teaspoon (up to 4 teaspoons), if necessary. Add the cabbage, carrot, and scallions; mix to coat the vegetables with batter; and let rest for about 5 minutes.

In a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm 1½ teaspoons neutral oil until shimmering. Stir the batter mixture, add half of it to the skillet, and immediately spread it into a roughly 7-inch round. Cook, undisturbed, until well browned on the bottom, about 3½ minutes. With a rubber spatula, flip the pancake and cook the second side, adjusting the heat if necessary, until the second side is spotted with brown, about 3½ minutes longer. Transfer the pancake to the prepared rack and place in the oven to keep warm. Add the remaining 1½ teaspoons neutral oil to the skillet, warm until shimmering, and repeat to cook the remaining batter into a second pancake. Transfer the pancake from the oven to a plate, add the second pancake, and set them aside to cool for about 4 minutes. Cut the pancakes into wedges and serve with the crème fraîche mixture.

## Halfling Iron Rations

**Makes** about 4 cups

1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats

½ cup slivered almonds

½ cup coarsely chopped walnuts

½ cup raw pepitas

1½ tablespoons flaxseed

1½ tablespoons sesame seeds

1 egg white

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar

1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme

1½ teaspoons kosher salt

¾ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

¾ teaspoon paprika

¾ teaspoon garlic powder

¾ teaspoon ground coriander

1 pinch cayenne pepper

Great as a snack, iron rations also make an excellent crunchy topping for thick soups such as Seelie Court Cheese and Potato Soup, salads, roasted vegetables, ratatouille, avocado toast, and deviled eggs.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 325°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat and set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the oats, almonds, walnuts, pepitas, flaxseed, and sesame seeds and stir to mix. In another medium bowl, combine the egg white, olive oil, Worcestershire, brown sugar, thyme, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, coriander, and cayenne and whisk vigorously until well blended. Pour the liquid mixture over the dry mixture and, using a flexible spatula, fold and stir until all the dry ingredients are well coated. Scrape the seed-oat mixture into the center of the prepared baking sheet and, using a large metal spatula, spread and firmly press into an even layer, roughly ⅜ inch thick (the shape is unimportant). The mixture will stick to the spatula as you work—simply scrape it off and continue.

Bake the granola until golden brown in the center and a little darker around the edges, about 25 minutes, rotating the pan about halfway through. Using the metal spatula, turn the granola; it will break into shards as you work, which is fine, but try to keep them as large as possible. Redistribute the granola into an even layer and continue to bake until it is deep golden brown, about 5 minutes longer. Let the granola cool to room temperature on the baking sheet (it will crisp further as it cools). If desired, break it into smaller pieces.

Store the granola in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.

## Honey Milk

**Makes** 4 cups

4 cups whole milk

1½ tablespoons honey

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the milk and honey and bring to a bare simmer, stirring to dissolve the honey. Remove from the heat and let the mixture cool until barely warm. Pour it into a container with a tight-fitting lid and seal. Refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours, before serving.

## Purple Grapemash No. 3

**Serves** 2

4 ounces white or amber rum

1 ounce fresh lime juice, plus 2 lime slices

½ cup grape jelly

2 cups small ice cubes

To chill a sturdy wine glass, put it in the freezer for an hour before using.

Chill two sturdy wine glasses, stemmed or not, or margarita glasses.

In a blender, combine the rum, lime juice, grape jelly, and ice cubes and blend until the ice is finely crushed and the mixture is uniform, slushy, and moves easily in the blender jar (the timing will depend on the power of your blender). Divide the mixture between the prepared glasses, garnish each with a lime slice, and serve immediately, with straws, if desired.

## Quij's Plate

**Serves** 4

3 tablespoons neutral oil

1 pound fresh sausage (your choice of flavor), casings removed

2 pounds red or all-purpose potatoes, cut into ½-inch cubes

Kosher salt

⅓ cup water

2 medium yellow onions, chopped

1 large red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and chopped

1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage, or 2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme or rosemary

1½ teaspoons pressed or grated garlic

¼ cup half-and-half

Freshly ground black pepper

½ cup chopped fresh parsley

4 eggs

In a large skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil until shimmering. Add the sausage and cook, stirring and breaking it into small pieces, until it no longer appears raw, 3 to 4 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to a bowl or plate, leaving behind the rendered fat.

In the same skillet over medium heat, warm the remaining 2 tablespoons neutral oil with the sausage fat until shimmering. Add the potatoes and ¼ teaspoon salt and stir to coat the potatoes with the oil and fat. Add the water, cover, and cook until the potatoes are just tender, 12 to 14 minutes. Uncover the skillet; add the onions, bell pepper, and ½ teaspoon salt; and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and light golden, about 8 minutes. Add the sage and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the half-and-half, 1 teaspoon salt, and black pepper to taste, stirring until well blended. Pat the mixture flat in the pan, adjust the heat to medium-high, and cook, undisturbed, until the visible moisture evaporates, there is no more visible bubbling on the surface, and the bottom begins to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Using a wooden spoon or a stiff spatula, stir the mixture, scraping the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Return the sausage to the pan and add most of the parsley, stirring to blend. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

Using the back of a spoon, make an indentation for each egg, crack an egg into each, and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Cover the skillet, adjust the heat to medium, and cook until the egg whites are set and the yolks are warm and slightly thickened but still liquid, 6 to 9 minutes, depending on how firm you like your eggs. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley before serving.

## Tavern Crickets

**Makes** 3 cups

1½ tablespoons chile-lime seasoning (such as Tajín)

2 teaspoons garlic powder

½ teaspoon cayenne pepper

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 cup roasted and salted peanuts

1 cup raw pepitas

1 cup whole roasted crickets

2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 300°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat.

In a small bowl, combine the chile-lime seasoning, garlic powder, cayenne, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon black pepper and whisk to incorporate. Set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the peanuts, pepitas, and crickets and stir to blend. Add the melted butter, stir, and toss to coat the mixture evenly. Add the spice mixture and toss again to coat. Evenly spread the mixture on the prepared baking sheet.

Bake the crickets until dry and fragrant, about 20 minutes, stirring well three times during the baking time. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Let cool to room temperature.

Tavern Crickets can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.

## Two Hares Inn Rabbit Stew

**Serves** 4

8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (2½ to 3 pounds), trimmed and dried well with paper towels

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 tablespoons neutral oil

1 pound cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and quartered (small ones halved)

2 medium yellow onions, halved pole to pole and each half thinly sliced lengthwise

2 bay leaves

2½ teaspoons pressed or grated garlic

2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme, or 1 teaspoon dried

2 teaspoons minced fresh oregano or rosemary

1½ tablespoons all-purpose flour

¾ cup dry white wine

One 14½-ounce can diced tomatoes, drained

¾ cup low-sodium chicken broth

⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley

Sprinkle the chicken thighs all over with salt and pepper.

In a large sauté pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil until shimmering. Arrange half the chicken thighs skin-side down in the pan, adjust the heat to medium, and cook, undisturbed, until the skin is browned, about 5 minutes. Flip the chicken and continue to cook, undisturbed, until the second side is browned, about 5 minutes longer (adjust the heat if necessary to avoid scorching). Transfer the chicken to a large plate. Repeat to brown the remaining chicken thighs. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, remove and discard the skin. Remove and discard all but 1½ tablespoons of the fat from the pan.

Adjust the heat to medium-high, add the mushrooms and ¼ teaspoon salt to the pan, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms release their liquid and it evaporates, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the onions, bay leaves, and ¼ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms brown and the onions soften, about 4 minutes longer. Adjust the heat to medium; add the garlic, thyme, oregano, and flour; and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and the flour films the bottom of the pan, about 1 minute longer. Add the wine, adjust the heat to high, and bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon until the film of browned flour dissolves into and thickens the liquid, about 1 minute longer. Add the tomatoes and chicken broth, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Add the chicken thighs with any accumulated juices and return to a simmer. Adjust the heat to low, cover, and let simmer gently until the chicken is cooked through and very tender, 35 to 45 minutes, flipping the chicken pieces about halfway through. Transfer the chicken to a serving platter, tent loosely with aluminum foil to keep warm, and set aside.

Remove the pan from the heat. Let the braising liquid rest for about 5 minutes, remove the bay leaves, and spoon off as much fat as possible (or use a fat separator). Set the pan over medium-high heat, add any accumulated juices from the chicken, bring to a boil, and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced slightly, about 4 minutes longer. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Stir in most of the parsley. Pour the sauce over and around the chicken. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley before serving.

## Whole Roast Boar

**Serves** 8 to 10

3 tablespoons light brown sugar

3 tablespoons kosher salt

1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper

One 8-pound whole bone-in pork butt (also known as shoulder butt), skinned, with fat cap attached

2 to 3 cups water, plus more as needed

#### Port Sauce

2 tablespoons reserved pork fat (from above)

½ cup minced shallots

1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme

Kosher salt

2 tablespoons tomato paste

1 cup ruby port

¾ cup low-sodium chicken broth

2 tablespoons red currant jam

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1½ teaspoons sherry vinegar

Freshly ground black pepper

In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, salt, and pepper and whisk to blend. Using a very sharp knife, cut slits about 1 inch apart in a crosshatch pattern across the entire fat cap of the pork, taking care to cut all the way through the layer of fat, but not into the meat beneath it. Sprinkle the brown sugar-salt mixture all over the pork, making sure to rub it into the slits. Wrap the meat tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours.

With a rack in the lowest position, preheat the oven to 325°F. Coat a roasting rack with nonstick cooking spray and set it in a large roasting pan.

Unwrap the pork and, with paper towels, blot the surface dry and remove any excess salt mixture if it hasn't completely dissolved. Place the pork on the prepared roasting rack, fat cap-side up, and pour the water into the pan, making sure it does not touch the bottom of the pork. Roast until the pork is very tender (a paring knife should slip in and out of the meat very easily) and the meat near the bone (but not touching it) registers 190°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 hours, checking once or twice on the water level in the roasting pan. If there is less than ¾ cup, add more. Transfer the pork to a platter or carving board, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 30 minutes. Pour the liquid from the roasting pan into a fat separator or a narrow, heatproof container, and allow it to settle for 10 minutes. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the fat for the sauce and discard the rest.

If desired, make extra-crisp cracklings by raising the oven temperature to 475°F and returning the rested pork to the roasting pan, fat cap-side up. Roast until the cracklings are dark, blistered, and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Return the pork to the platter or carving board, cover loosely with foil, and let rest for 15 minutes longer.

Cut the pork into thick slices, or using a fork, gently pull apart into small chunks. Arrange on a serving platter and cover with foil until the sauce is finished.

***To make the port sauce:.*** In a medium skillet over medium heat, warm the reserved pork fat until shimmering. Add the shallots, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant and a shade darker, about 1½ minutes. Add the port, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a strong simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by a little less than half, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken broth (and any juices accumulated from the rested pork), return the mixture to a strong simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced again by slightly less than half, about 3 minutes longer. Adjust the heat to medium, add the jam, and whisk vigorously until dissolved and incorporated. Remove the skillet from the heat, add the butter and vinegar, and whisk to incorporate. Season generously with pepper and whisk to incorporate. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

Serve the pork and sauce together.

## Bacon-Wrapped Smoked Mussels

**Serves** 4 as a snack

6 slices bacon

24 highest-quality smoked mussels (see Cook's Note)

Plump, high-quality mussels are imperative here—it's not worth making the recipe with tinned smoked mussels. Source the mussels from a small producer such as Ducktrap River of Maine, a smokehouse, or a fishmonger that sells smoked fish.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a plate with paper towels and set aside. Place a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet and set aside.

In a medium nonstick skillet over medium-low heat, cook the bacon until it begins to render some fat, is softened, and is half cooked, about 8 minutes, flipping the pieces halfway through. Transfer the bacon to the prepared plate to drain briefly.

Move the bacon to a cutting board, setting the plate aside. Cut the slices in half crosswise. Lay two mussels on a half slice of bacon, wrap the bacon around them, and secure with a toothpick. Repeat with the remaining mussels and bacon. Arrange the bundles on the prepared wire rack about 1 inch apart.

Place the baking sheet in the oven and roast the mussels until browned and starting to crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer to the plate and let rest for 1 minute. Serve immediately; these should be eaten hot and fresh.

## Beer Bread

**Serves** 2

3 cups all-purpose flour

1½ tablespoons granulated sugar

1 tablespoon baking powder

1 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

One 12-ounce bottle ale (preferably an IPA), or another style of beer (see Cook's Note)

3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Different types of beer produce different flavors in this bread. For instance, India pale ale (IPA) provides a noticeably pleasant beer flavor, whereas American-style lagers are so mild they can be difficult to detect. Dark beers such as porter or stout provide a richer flavor along with a bit of residual bitterness.

Beer bread is sensational with soups, as a snack on its own, or as a sponge to soak up the gravied jus of roasted game. Just don't expect it to last long once it's out of the oven.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 375°F. Coat a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper and whisk to incorporate. Add the beer and, using a flexible spatula, stir to form a lumpy batter (do not overmix). Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it into the corners, if necessary. Pour about 2 tablespoons of the melted butter evenly over the batter.

Bake the bread until deep golden brown and a skewer inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 55 minutes, rotating the pan and brushing the top of the loaf with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter halfway through. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool for about 10 minutes. Remove the loaf from the pan, and let cool on the rack for 20 minutes longer. Slice the bread with a serrated knife and serve barely warm or at room temperature.

## Chickpea and Spicy Sausage Soup

**Makes** about 2½ quarts

Three 15-ounce cans chickpeas

¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil

¾ pound chouriço, linguiça, or Spanish (dry-cured) chorizo, halved lengthwise and sliced ½ inch thick (see Cook's Note)

1 large yellow onion, chopped

2 large celery ribs, trimmed and sliced ½ inch thick

2 large bay leaves

Kosher salt

1 tablespoon pressed or grated garlic

½ teaspoon red pepper flakes

4 cups low-sodium chicken broth

1 cup water

One 8-ounce can tomato sauce

Freshly ground black pepper

⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley

If you like spicy heat, consider choosing hot chouriço.

To make it a meal, serve the soup over hot, freshly cooked rice.

Line a plate with paper towels and set aside. Empty two cans of the chickpeas, with their liquid, into a medium bowl. Drain the third can, rinse the chickpeas, and transfer to the same bowl. Set aside.

In a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the chouriço and cook until it browns slightly and tints the oil red, 5 to 6 minutes, stirring once or twice. With a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to the prepared plate to drain. Pour all but about 1 tablespoon of the oil into a small bowl, and set aside.

Return the pan to medium heat and add the onion, celery, bay leaves, and ½ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, until the vegetables begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium-low, cover, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have released their juices, about 4 minutes longer. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the chicken broth, water, tomato sauce, and chickpeas with their liquid. Adjust the heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. Adjust the heat to low, cover, and let simmer to soften the chickpeas further and blend the flavors, stirring occasionally, about 40 minutes. Add the cooked sausage and 1 teaspoon salt, season with black pepper, and continue simmering to heat the sausage through. Remove the bay leaves, add most of the parsley, and stir to mix. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and black pepper, if necessary. Divide among individual plates. Drizzle with the reserved sausage cooking oil and sprinkle with some of the remaining parsley before serving.

## Chirper's Sugar Biscuits

**Makes** 12 buns

¼ cup granulated sugar

1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest

3 tablespoons packed light or dark brown sugar

¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon

½ teaspoon ground cardamom

1 pinch kosher salt

1 sheet frozen all-butter puff pastry (see Cook's Notes), thawed according to package directions and still cool

2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus 2 tablespoons melted

The dimensions of puff pastry sheets vary by brand, so depending on which one you use, you may or may not have to roll it to the required length. Regardless, make sure your pastry is completely thawed, so you can unfold it initially, and roll it up with the filling, without it cracking. It should still be cool, though, because warm puff pastry can become sticky. Finally, don't allow the baked buns to cool completely in the muffin tin, or they will stick to the cups.

All that said, don't allow all this information daunt you. The buns are, in fact, easy to form and bake, and easier yet to eat. On that note, they're best within a couple of hours of baking. You can, however, re-crisp them with about a 5-minute stay in a 350°F oven.

In a medium bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the granulated sugar and the lemon zest and stir until the sugar is moist and fragrant. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, and salt and stir to mix thoroughly. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the mixture.

Place a sheet of parchment paper on your work surface and evenly sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar over it. On the sugared paper, unfold the puff pastry (which should be rectangular) and, if it is less than 15 inches long, place a second parchment sheet over it and use a rolling pin to gently roll it to that length (taking care not to press too hard, which compresses the layers, decreasing their puff when baked). Remove the top parchment sheet. If necessary, using your fingers, gently loosen the long edge of the pastry nearest you from the bottom piece of parchment paper (this will make it easier to begin rolling it with the filling). Evenly spread the room-temperature butter over the pastry and sprinkle the larger quantity of the sugar mixture over the butter, all the way to the edges. Lay a piece of parchment paper over the sugar mixture, gently press down to help the mixture adhere, and remove the parchment.

Starting with the long side that you loosened, gently roll the pastry into a very tight, even, compact cylinder. Pinch the seam along the entire length of the cylinder to seal (it may pop open as the buns bake, which is fine). Slide the cylinder and the parchment sheet it's on onto a large baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm, about 45 minutes.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 400°F. Coat the cups of a standard muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray, and set aside.

Remove the plastic from the pastry, place the cylinder seam-side down on a cutting board, and, using a serrated knife in a sawing motion, cut the cylinder in half crosswise. Cut each half into sixths and place, cut-side up, in a prepared muffin cup.

Bake the buns until puffed and dark golden brown, about 20 minutes, rotating the muffin tin about halfway through. Remove the buns from the oven and, working quickly, brush with the melted butter and sprinkle each with about ½ teaspoon of the reserved sugar mixture. Let cool for 3 minutes, then carefully remove the buns from the muffin tin while still hot. Let cool on the rack to room temperature (they'll crisp up more as they cool) before serving.

## Emerald Chicken

**Serves** 4 to 6

8 ounces chicken livers, trimmed of fat, membranes, and connective tissue

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

4 split bone-in chicken breasts (10 to 12 ounces each)

2 tablespoons neutral oil

1 pound tomatillos, husked and washed

3 medium yellow onions; 1 thickly sliced and 2 quartered

6 garlic cloves; 3 left whole with skins on and 3 pressed or grated

3 medium serrano or jalapeño chiles (see Cook's Note)

⅓ cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves and small stems

2 teaspoons fresh lime juice

1 teaspoon granulated sugar

1 pound baby spinach

The heat of serranos and jalapeños can vary significantly, so you may want to take a tiny nibble to gauge how hot yours are and use more than three if it seems too tame. Here, we use them whole, with their seeds and inner membranes, to harness all the heat.

The chicken livers can pop and spit a bit as they cook, so if you have a splatter screen, this is a great time to deploy it.

Rice or quinoa make good accompaniments.

Rinse the chicken livers, pat dry with paper towels, and put in the refrigerator.

In a small bowl or ramekin, combine 2½ teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper, stir to mix, and set aside. Working with one chicken breast at a time, gently shimmy your finger between the skin and the meat, loosening but not detaching the skin. Fold over the skin to expose the meat, sprinkle about one-fourth of the salt and pepper mixture evenly over the meat, and lay the skin back in place. Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts and salt and pepper. Put the chicken in the refrigerator.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 325°F.

In a large ovenproof skillet over high heat, warm 2 teaspoons of the neutral oil until shimmering. Add the tomatillos, sliced onion, whole garlic, and chiles and cook, undisturbed, until deeply charred on the bottom, about 6 minutes. Using tongs, flip everything and cook, undisturbed, until the second side is charred, about 6 minutes longer. Transfer the tomatillos, onion, and chiles to a blender. Transfer the garlic to a small plate. When the garlic is cool enough to handle, squeeze the cloves out of the skins and add to the blender along with the cilantro, lime juice, sugar, and 1 teaspoon salt. Blend until the mixture is thoroughly pureed. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt, if necessary, and blend into a salsa.

Set the skillet over medium-high heat, add 2 teaspoons neutral oil, and warm until shimmering. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook, undisturbed, until well browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the chicken pieces and tuck the onion quarters around the chicken. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast the chicken until it registers 160°F on an instant-read thermometer, 25 to 40 minutes. Leaving the onions and chicken juices in the skillet, transfer the chicken to a plate and let rest for 5 minutes. Cut each chicken breast in half crosswise and cover with foil to keep warm.

While the chicken rests, set a strainer over a medium bowl.

In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, warm about 1 tablespoon of the chicken juices. Add as much spinach as will fit comfortably in the skillet and cook, stirring and turning constantly, until wilted and bright green, about 1 minute. Add the remaining spinach in batches, cooking and stirring, until all the spinach is wilted and bright green, about 3 minutes longer. About halfway through the cooking time, add the pressed garlic. Scrape the spinach and garlic into the strainer and, using tongs, squeeze to release as much liquid as possible. Add the drained spinach to the pan with the onions and chicken juices, add ½ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper, and toss to coat. Arrange the spinach, onions, and chicken on a serving platter, and set aside.

Return the nonstick skillet to medium-high heat, add the remaining 2 teaspoons neutral oil, and warm until shimmering. Lightly sprinkle the chicken livers all over with salt and pepper and cook, undisturbed, until the bottoms are lightly browned, about 2½ minutes. Flip the livers and cook until the second sides are lightly browned, about 2 minutes longer (do not overcook—they should remain rosy inside). Using tongs, remove the livers from the pan and arrange on the platter with the spinach and chicken.

Pour about half the salsa over the chicken and livers. Serve immediately, passing the remaining salsa on the side.

## Fire-Wrapped Golden Fish

**Serves** 4

6 cups canola oil or corn oil

Kosher salt

2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper

1½ teaspoons cayenne pepper

Ice cubes

About 1½ cups cold tap water

1 cup all-purpose flour

1½ tablespoons chili powder

2 teaspoons garlic powder

1½ pounds firm, meaty white-fleshed fish fillets (such as halibut, tilapia, or mahi-mahi), skinned and cut into 3 by 1-inch strips

¾ cup plus 1 tablespoon cold sparkling water

Lime wedges for serving

Preheat the oven to 200°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels and set aside. Place a wire rack on another large rimmed baking sheet and set aside.

Clip a deep-fry or candy thermometer to the side of a medium Dutch oven over medium-high heat and warm the canola oil to 360°F. In a small bowl, combine 2 teaspoons salt, the black pepper, and ¾ teaspoon of the cayenne and stir to mix.

While the oil heats, fill a large bowl one-third of the way with ice and add the tap water. In a medium bowl (preferably stainless steel), combine the flour, chili powder, garlic powder, remaining ¾ teaspoon cayenne, and ¾ teaspoon salt and whisk to incorporate. Set this bowl in the bowl of ice water to chill the flour mixture.

Spread the fish on a platter or a third rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle the fish all over with the seasoning mixture and set aside.

When the oil is at temperature, add the sparkling water to the flour mixture and stir just until the wet and dry ingredients are mixed but still a little lumpy (do not overmix).

Add six pieces of fish to the batter and coat them thoroughly. Using tongs or chopsticks, remove three pieces, allowing excess batter to drip back into the bowl, and slip the fish into the oil. Wait 30 seconds and repeat with the other three battered pieces. Fry until slightly puffed and golden brown, turning the pieces once or twice to promote even frying and prevent them from sticking to each other, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain 360°F, 4 to 5 minutes. Using a spider skimmer, slotted spoon, or long tongs, transfer the fried fish to the paper towel–lined baking sheet to drain for about 30 seconds. Sprinkle the fried fish lightly with salt, transfer to the prepared wire rack set, and place in the oven to keep warm. Allow the oil to return to 360°F and repeat until all the fish are cooked. Serve immediately with lime wedges.

## Fried Bread and Spices

**Makes** 6 slices

2½ teaspoons paprika

1 teaspoon ground cumin

1 teaspoon ground coriander

1 teaspoon ground fennel

1 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper

6 slices country, French, or Italian bread, ¾ inch thick and about 5 inches wide

½ cup extra-virgin olive oil

1 garlic clove (optional)

In a small bowl, combine the paprika, cumin, coriander, fennel, salt, black pepper, and cayenne and stir to incorporate. Brush both sides of each bread slice with about 2 teaspoons of the olive oil.

In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, place as many slices of bread as will fit in a single layer. Cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Near the end of that time, sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of the spice mixture evenly over each slice of bread. Carefully flip the bread so the spiced side is down and continue to cook until lightly browned on the second side and fragrant, about 1½ minutes longer. Remove the bread from the pan, and repeat to cook the remaining slices. Rub each slice lightly on either side with the garlic clove, if desired, before serving.

## Harmonious Barracks Meatloaf

**Serves** 6 to 8

2 cups lightly packed, torn crustless pieces French, Italian, or other sturdy white bread (1-inch pieces)

⅔ cup whole or 2% milk

2 eggs, beaten

1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped

Kosher salt

2 tablespoons pressed or grated garlic

2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary

1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme

1½ pounds ground lamb

½ pound ground chuck (preferably 85% lean)

1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

½ cup finely chopped fresh parsley

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Line a large wire rack with foil and poke holes in the foil. Set the rack on the baking sheet and set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the bread and milk and let soak, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 15 minutes. With a potato masher or fork, mash the mixture to a loose paste. Add the eggs and stir vigorously to combine.

In a medium skillet over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onion and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic, rosemary, and thyme and continue to cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Scrape into a bowl and let cool to room temperature.

Add the lamb, chuck, onion mixture, 2 teaspoons salt, and the pepper to the bread mixture. Set aside 1 tablespoon of the parsley, and add the remaining 7 tablespoons to the bowl. Fold and stir the mixture gently until well blended. On the prepared rack, form the mixture into a roughly 9 by 5-inch loaf.

Bake the meatloaf until an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center registers 155° to 160°F, about 1¼ hours. Let the meatloaf cool for about 10 minutes, then transfer to a cutting board or serving plate. Slice it with a serrated blade and serve.

## Kaeth

**Makes** about 2½ cups

⅓ cup ground dark-roast coffee

3 cups water

2 tablespoons light brown sugar

½ teaspoon molasses (not blackstrap)

1 cinnamon stick, broken in half

1 teaspoon crushed anise seeds

1½ tablespoons finely grated orange zest

1 small pinch kosher salt

If you prefer your kaeth iced, pour it from the French press into a jar with a tight-fitting lid. Allow it to cool to room temperature, seal the lid, and refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours. Serve over ice.

Place the coffee in a French press and set aside.

In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the water, brown sugar, molasses, cinnamon stick, anise seeds, orange zest, and salt and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Adjust the heat to medium and let simmer until the mixture is fragrant and reduced to about 2⅔ cups, about 14 minutes. Pour the mixture into the French press and stir to fully moisten the coffee grounds. Position the lid on the pot and let steep for 4 minutes before slowly pressing the plunger. Serve immediately.

## Sensate Palate Cleanser

**Makes** about 2 quarts

1 tablespoon unsalted butter

1 medium leek (white and light green parts), chopped

Kosher salt

3 medium-small English cucumbers

3 cups low-sodium chicken broth

⅔ cup half-and-half

1½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice

Freshly ground black pepper

3 tablespoons snipped fresh chives

In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the leek and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the leek begins to soften, about 2½ minutes. Adjust the heat to medium-low, cover, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the leek has released its juices, about 5 minutes longer. Remove from the heat and let cool briefly.

Meanwhile, peel one of the cucumbers, leaving about one-fourth of the skin on for a little texture and color. Peel the other two cucumbers completely. Halve all the cucumbers lengthwise and remove the seeds. Finely dice one of the fully peeled halves and set aside. Cut the remaining five halves into roughly 1-inch pieces.

In a blender, combine one-third of the roughly chopped cucumbers, one-third of the leek, and 1 cup of the chicken broth and puree until very smooth, about 40 seconds. Pour the mixture into a large bowl (preferably stainless steel) and set aside. Repeat to blend another third of the cucumbers, leeks, and broth, pouring this batch into the bowl with the first one. For the last batch, combine the remaining roughly chopped cucumber, remaining leeks, and remaining 1 cup chicken broth in the blender; add the half-and-half; and puree. Add to the bowl, stir in the lemon juice and ¾ teaspoon salt, and season with pepper. Stir in the diced cucumber. Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 4 hours.

When ready to serve, stir the soup to blend again, and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Ladle into individual bowls and garnish each with a sprinkle of pepper and some chives.

## Silverfruit Pie

**Serves** 8

2 teaspoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus 5 tablespoons melted and still warm

14 whole graham crackers, broken into rough pieces

3 tablespoons light brown sugar

Kosher salt

One 20-ounce can lychees (peeled, pitted, and in heavy syrup)

12 ounces mascarpone, at cool room temperature

3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

2 teaspoons rosewater

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 tablespoons apple jelly

1½ teaspoons finely grated lemon zest

Rather than warming the apple jelly on the stovetop, you can warm it in a microwave-safe container in the microwave, using partial power, for about 30 seconds, stopping to check and stir it about every 10 seconds.

Even though you drain and dry the lychees, they'll retain enough moisture to weep on the pie if they sit for too long. It's best to serve the pie no more than an hour after glazing it. If you have leftovers, refrigerate them and expect the jam to slide off the lychees and pool between them and at the edges of the crust. If you'd like, use a small bit of paper towel to blot away visible liquid before serving.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 350°F. Coat a 9-inch pie plate with the room-temperature butter, and set aside.

In a food processor, process the graham crackers to fine crumbs, about 20 seconds. Add the brown sugar and 1 pinch salt and pulse to combine. With the motor running, slowly add the melted butter through the feed tube and process until the mixture resembles wet sand, about 20 seconds. Pour the mixture into the pie plate and press into an even, compact layer across the bottom and up the sides. Wipe out the food processor work bowl to use again.

Bake the crust until lightly browned and fragrant, about 12 minutes, rotating the pie plate about halfway through. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature (the crust will firm up as it cools).

Meanwhile, drain the lychees well and blot them dry with paper towel. Line a plate or baking sheet with paper towels in a double layer. Cut each lychee in half, place them cut sides down on the paper towel-lined plate, and refrigerate until needed, at least 1 hour.

Add the mascarpone, confectioners' sugar, rosewater, vanilla, and ¼ teaspoon salt to the food processor and pulse until combined and smooth, stopping once or twice to scrape down the work bowl, about 10 two-second pulses. Scrape the mixture into the crust, gently spread it in an even layer, and refrigerate until firmer, at least 1 hour. Arrange the lychees, cut-sides down, over the mascarpone, covering the entire surface, and gently press them into the mixture to anchor.

In a small saucepan over medium heat, warm the apple jelly until warm to the touch and beginning to become fluid, stirring to smooth out any lumps. Off heat, cool the fluid jelly for about 5 minutes. Stir it again and, using a pastry brush, gently dab and brush the jelly over the lychees. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, sprinkle the lemon zest over the pie, and serve immediately.

## Boar Hock Soup

**Makes** about 2½ quarts

2 pounds pork butt, or boneless country-style ribs, patted dry with a paper towel

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil

3 large carrots, peeled and chopped

2 medium yellow onions, chopped

2 large bay leaves

1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme

2 teaspoons ground fennel

1 tablespoon pressed or grated garlic

6 cups low-sodium chicken broth

1½ pounds Yukon gold or all-purpose potatoes, peeled and cut into ¾-inch chunks

1½ pounds leeks (white and light green parts), halved lengthwise and cut into ¾-inch pieces

1½ cups cooked, peeled chestnuts, coarsely chopped

1½ teaspoons sherry vinegar

½ cup chopped fresh parsley

Sprinkle the pork all over with 1½ teaspoons salt and ¾ teaspoon pepper.

In a large Dutch oven over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the pork in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Turn the pork and continue cooking, undisturbed, to brown the second side, about 4 minutes longer. Transfer the pork to a large bowl, leaving the fat in the pot. When the pork is cool enough to handle, cut into ¾-inch pieces, discarding any large pieces of fat as you work. Set aside.

Return the Dutch oven to medium-high heat. Add the carrots, onions, bay leaves, thyme, fennel, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to loosen and dissolve the caramelized bits, until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium-low, cover, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables release their juices, about 6 minutes longer. Scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen and dissolve the caramelized bits. Adjust the heat to medium-high, add the garlic, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the chicken broth and reserved pork with its accumulated juices and bring to a strong simmer. If foam forms on the surface, skim and discard it. Adjust the heat to low, cover, and let simmer until the pork is tender, about 40 minutes.

Adjust the heat to medium-high and bring the soup to a strong simmer. Add the potatoes, leeks, 1¼ cups of the chestnuts, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and return to a simmer, stirring. Adjust the heat to medium-low, replace the cover, and continue simmering until the potato cubes and leeks begin to soften, about 20 minutes longer. Remove the soup from the heat and let rest for about 30 minutes for the flavors to meld (the potatoes and leeks will finish cooking during the rest). Remove the bay leaves.

Transfer about ¾ cup of the soup, including some potato cubes, to a blender. Add the reserved ¼ cup chestnuts and blend as smooth as possible, about 30 seconds. Scrape the pureed mixture into the pot, add the vinegar, and stir to incorporate. If necessary, reheat the soup over medium heat, and taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Add most of the parsley, stir to blend, and sprinkle each portion with some of the remaining parsley before serving.

## Cloaks

**Makes** about 20 cloaks

1½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks

5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small cubes, at room temperature

1¼ cups half-and-half

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 pinch freshly ground nutmeg

1 pinch cayenne pepper

1 egg plus 2 egg yolks, beaten

½ teaspoon baking powder

If you don't have a pastry bag, you can get away with a heavy-duty ziplock freezer bag as a substitute. Snip off about ⅜ inch from a bottom corner and fit the star tip into the hole, pushing it through from inside the bag.

Although you'll sacrifice the crisp ridges created by the star tip, you can use a spoon to shape the mounds into circles or ovals of about the same dimensions as the piped version, and run the tines of a fork over the surface to add texture.

Place the potatoes in a large microwave-safe bowl, cover with a microwave-safe lid or plate, and microwave until very tender, about 18 minutes, stirring the potatoes twice during that time. Spread the potatoes on a baking sheet or large plate and let cool until you can handle them, about 5 minutes. Set a potato ricer over the empty bowl and rice the potatoes into it. Add half the butter cubes and stir to incorporate. Add the half-and-half, 2 teaspoons salt, ¾ teaspoon pepper, the nutmeg, and cayenne and stir to incorporate. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Add the egg and yolks and baking powder and stir until the mixture is uniform and very smooth. Let cool to room temperature, add the remaining butter cubes, and fold to incorporate.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 475°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat and coat it lightly with nonstick cooking spray.

Scrape the potato mixture into a piping bag fitted with a ½-inch star tip. Hold the filled pastry bag slightly above the prepared baking sheet and apply steady, gentle, downward pressure to pipe a mound roughly 2 inches in diameter and 2 inches high. Work your way out in a tight circular motion, and then back in again to build height. Pipe twenty mounds total, with about 1 inch between them (five rows of four mounds). Lightly coat the mounds with cooking spray.

Bake the cloaks until golden brown, about 14 minutes, rotating the baking sheet about halfway through. Let cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes, then, using a spatula, transfer to a serving platter. Serve immediately.

## Irlymeyer's Dragonfire Punch

**Makes** about 2½ quarts

3 cups cranberry juice cocktail

⅓ cup frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed

½ cup frozen pineapple juice concentrate, thawed

3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

1 cup brandy

1 cup large ice cubes (see Cook's Note), plus more for serving

One 750 ml bottle Prosecco or other sparkling wine, cold

1 large orange, scrubbed and thinly sliced

A small block of ice will melt more slowly than the cup of ice cubes. To make such a block, fill a 1-quart plastic container (such as a deli container) with water and freeze it overnight. To loosen the block of ice from the container, hold it briefly under hot running water.

In a large bowl or pitcher, combine the cranberry juice cocktail, orange juice concentrate, pineapple juice concentrate, lemon juice, and brandy and stir to blend. (This mix can be made 1 day ahead, covered, and refrigerated.)

When ready to serve, add the ice to the mix and stir to chill and blend. Add the Prosecco and stir gently. Fill each glass with ice, pour in the punch, and garnish with an orange slice.

## Kender Loaf

**Serves** 6 to 8

One 1-pound loaf French or Italian bread (see Cook's Note)

⅓ cup granulated sugar

2 teaspoons finely grated lemon or orange zest

⅓ cup light brown sugar

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

1¾ cups half-and-half

2 eggs plus 2 egg yolks

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Kosher salt

1 cup golden raisins

5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature

The best bread for this recipe is a round or oval loaf with a thin, light-colored crust. Avoid artisan or sourdough loaves with thick crusts. If you accidentally break through the bottom of the loaf while removing the crumb, patch the hole with a crusty piece from the top.

Like any bread pudding, a scoop of ice cream, a dollop of whipped cream, or a drizzle of custard sauce are welcome partners.

Leftover slices of the pudding are great for hearty French toast!

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 350°F.

With the loaf right-side up, use a serrated knife to cut around the perimeter of the bread, about 1 inch from the sides, taking care to not pierce the bottom. Pull off the top of the bread and tear it into roughly 1-inch pieces. Hollow out the rest of the loaf by carefully tearing out the crumb in roughly 1-inch pieces. Set the bread shell aside and spread the torn pieces on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake the bread pieces, tossing occasionally, until toasted and light golden, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the baking sheet about halfway through. Remove from the oven and let cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes. Leave the oven on.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the granulated sugar and lemon zest and stir until moist and fragrant. In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of the lemon sugar, the brown sugar, and cinnamon, breaking up any lumps of brown sugar with your fingers, and set aside. In the large bowl with the lemon sugar, whisk in the half-and-half, eggs and egg yolks, vanilla, and 1 pinch salt and continue whisking until well blended. Add the toasted bread and raisins, then press and stir to submerge them as much as possible. Set aside to soak until the bread is thoroughly saturated, stirring and resubmerging occasionally, about 20 minutes.

Spread 3 tablespoons of the butter on the inside of the bread shell, then sprinkle with half of the brown sugar mixture. Place the bread shell on a rimmed baking sheet and fill with the soaked bread mixture, gently mounding it. Sprinkle the remaining brown sugar mixture over the surface of the filling and dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter.

Bake the pudding until a toothpick or thin knife inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes, rotating the baking sheet about halfway through. Set the pudding on a wire rack and let cool until just warm or at room temperature. Using a serrated knife, slice the pudding and serve.

## Kender Stumblenoodles

**Serves** 8

6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1 tablespoon paprika

½ teaspoon garlic powder

1 pinch cayenne pepper

3 cups whole milk

2 teaspoons Dijon mustard

2 ounces cream cheese, cut into 4 pieces, at room temperature

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

4½ cups lightly packed, coarsely grated sharp or extra-sharp Cheddar cheese (see Cook's Note)

12 ounces fusilli or rotini

1½ cups lightly packed, coarsely grated Gruyère cheese (see Cook's Note)

1⅓ cups panko breadcrumbs

It's best to grate your own cheese for this, as opposed to using pre-grated, which can be a touch grainy when melted because it includes additives to prevent clumping.

In this recipe, there's a lot of liquid and a lot of vigorous whisking, so choose a large, deep pot that can help contain the inevitable splashes.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 375°F. Smear a shallow 13 by 9-inch baking dish with 2 tablespoons of the butter, set it on a baking sheet, and set aside.

Fill a large pot with water, set over high heat, and bring to a boil.

Meanwhile, in another large pot over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Whisk in the flour, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne and cook, scraping the bottom of the pot, for 1 minute. Whisking constantly (and taking care to reach into the corners of the pot), gradually add the milk. Bring the mixture to a strong simmer, whisking the liquid and scraping the bottom of the pan often. Adjust the heat to medium and continue simmering and whisking until the sauce is thickened to the consistency of half-and-half, about 8 minutes longer.

Remove the pot from the heat; add the mustard, cream cheese, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper; and whisk vigorously to melt and incorporate the cream cheese. Whisking constantly but gently, add the Cheddar, about 1 cup at a time, taking care to fully melt and incorporate each addition before adding the next. The sauce should be smooth and uniform.

Add 1 tablespoon salt and the fusilli to the pot of boiling water and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, according to the package directions until about 2 minutes short of al dente (there should be some resistance to the tooth). Drain the pasta, add it to the sauce, and stir to coat thoroughly. Let the mixture cool briefly, add the Gruyère, and stir to incorporate. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Scrape the mixture into the prepared baking dish and smooth into an even layer.

In a small microwave-safe bowl in the microwave oven, or in a small pot over medium heat, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Add the panko and ¼ teaspoon salt, season with pepper, and toss to coat the breadcrumbs. Sprinkle the panko evenly over the pasta.

Bake the pasta until heated through, the surface is browned, and the edges are bubbly, 30 to 40 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Let rest briefly, 8 to 10 minutes, before serving.

## Kendermore Cobbler

**Serves** 4 to 6

#### Filling

3 pounds firm but ripe peaches, peeled, pitted, and cut into 1½-inch wedges, or 8 cups frozen peaches, thawed

3 tablespoons granulated sugar

1 pinch kosher salt

3 tablespoons light brown sugar

1 tablespoon cornstarch

¼ teaspoon ground cloves

3 tablespoons bourbon, amber or dark rum, brandy, or cognac (see Cook's Note)

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries (see Cook's Note)

#### Topping

5 tablespoons granulated sugar

¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon

1½ cups all-purpose flour

1½ teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon kosher salt

1 egg

⅓ cup buttermilk

3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

You can substitute 3 tablespoons of the exuded peach juices for the booze, if you wish.

If you use frozen blueberries, don't worry about defrosting them.

To make the filling: In a large strainer set over a large bowl, toss the peaches, granulated sugar, and salt and set aside to drain for 1 hour, tossing them once or twice during that time. Pour off the accumulated peach juices and reserve for another use, if desired.

In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, cornstarch, cloves, bourbon, and vanilla and whisk to incorporate.

Add the blueberries to the peaches, then add the cornstarch mixture and toss to coat. Scrape the filling into an 8-inch square pan with 2-inch sides, and spread into an even layer. Set aside.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat and set aside. Butter the inside of a ¼ cup dry measuring cup.

To make the topping: In a small bowl, combine 2 teaspoons of the granulated sugar and the cinnamon and stir to incorporate, then set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and remaining 4 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon granulated sugar and whisk to incorporate. In a medium bowl, combine the egg, buttermilk, melted butter, and vanilla and whisk until uniform. Add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture and, using a large spoon, fold and stir until a dough forms and no dry patches remain (do not overmix).

Add enough of the dough to fill three-fourths of the prepared measuring cup and lightly pat into the cup to shape it. Turn out the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough for a total of nine rounds, spacing them 1 inch apart. Sprinkle with the reserved cinnamon sugar.

Bake the rounds until puffed, very lightly browned on the bottom, and partially cooked through, about 7 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through. Transfer the parbaked biscuits to a plate and set aside.

Set the pan with the filling on the baking sheet. Bake until the peaches begin to soften and release their juices, 30 to 40 minutes. Arrange the parbaked biscuits over the peaches and continue baking until the peaches are tender and the biscuits are golden brown, about 15 minutes longer. Let cool on a wire rack for 25 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

## Plate of Silver

**Serves** 4

1½ pounds small (2-inch) red-skinned or Yukon gold creamer potatoes, scrubbed

4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

About 2 ounces white anchovy fillets or boquerónes (see Cook's Note)

2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Meaty marinated white anchovies are popular in Spain, where they're called boquerónes. Instead of being packed in oil or salt, the anchovies are marinated in vinegar, which gives them a piquant flavor and whitens the flesh. They're less salty and intense than their tinned, oil-packed brethren.

Using a second baking sheet will smash all the potatoes at once, whereas if you use the bottom of a mug or a potato masher, you will have to smash them individually.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 450°F. Spread the potatoes on a baking sheet and roast until they are very tender, about 35 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven (leave the oven on) and set the potatoes aside to cool for about 10 minutes.

When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, transfer to a large bowl. Brush the same baking sheet with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Return the potatoes to the baking sheet, spaced about 2½ inches apart. With another baking sheet or the bottom of a mug or a potato masher, sharply press down on the potatoes to break their skins and compress the flesh until about ¾ inch thick. Brush the potatoes with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Return the potatoes to the oven and roast until deep golden brown, about 25 minutes longer, turning the baking sheet halfway through. Taste a small piece of a potato and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

Arrange the potatoes on a serving platter, lay an anchovy fillet over each one, and sprinkle with the parsley. Serve immediately.

## Salbread

**Makes** one 8-inch square loaf

2 cups all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons baking powder

Kosher salt

1 cup granulated sugar

2 tablespoons finely grated lemon zest or orange zest

1 cup plain yogurt (preferably whole-milk)

2 eggs

½ teaspoon vanilla extract

½ cup neutral oil

Salbread can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 2 days.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 350°F. Coat an 8-inch square pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and ½ teaspoon salt and whisk to incorporate. In a large bowl, combine the sugar and lemon zest and stir until the sugar is moist and fragrant. Add the yogurt, eggs, vanilla, and neutral oil to the sugar and whisk vigorously to blend. Add the flour mixture and, using a flexible spatula, fold to blend the wet and dry ingredients just until no pockets of dry ingredients remain. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.

Bake the loaf until lightly browned, a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, and the edges begin to pull away from the pan, about 40 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature, about 40 minutes. Turn the bread out of the pan and cut into squares to serve.

## Stuffed Trout

**Serves** 4

Four 10- to 12-ounce whole trout, gutted

2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning

Freshly ground black pepper

2 large slices multigrain sandwich bread, crusts trimmed, torn into small pieces

3 tablespoons unsalted butter

Kosher salt

¼ cup minced shallot

¾ cup finely chopped red bell pepper

2 teaspoons pressed or grated garlic

2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest, plus 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving

⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley

Eating a whole trout is less intimidating than you may think. Peel back the skin to expose the flesh on one side. Starting at the equator of the exposed side of the fish, use a dinner knife to slide the flesh downward off the fish's skeleton. Repeat to slide off the flesh above the equator. Flip the fish and repeat to release the flesh on the second side.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 450°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat and set aside.

Rinse each trout under cold running water and, using a paper towel, dry very well, inside and out. Sprinkle the cavity of each trout evenly with ½ teaspoon Old Bay and ¼ teaspoon black pepper.

In a food processor, pulse the bread into crumbs the size of grains of rice, about five 2-second pulses.

In a medium skillet over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter. Add the breadcrumbs and ½ teaspoon salt and season with pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until deeply browned and crisp, about 6 minutes. Scrape the toasted breadcrumbs into a medium bowl and set aside.

Wipe the skillet clean and return it to medium heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and let warm until melted. Add the shallot, bell pepper, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring constantly, until the vegetables start to soften, about 2 minutes. Adjust the heat to low, cover, and cook until the vegetables appear moist, about 1½ minutes longer. Add the garlic and lemon zest and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Scrape the mixture into the bowl with the toasted breadcrumbs, add the lemon juice and parsley, and stir to combine into a stuffing. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

Place the trout on the prepared baking sheet. Spoon about ⅓ cup of the stuffing into the cavity of each trout, pressing it in with your fingers. Arrange the fish so there is about 1 inch between them.

Bake the trout until they feel firm when pressed gently with your finger, and the thickest part of the fish registers 140°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 12 minutes. Let the trout rest for 5 minutes. Using a fish spatula or another long spatula, carefully transfer the trout to a serving platter and serve with lemon wedges.

## Tarsis-Style Shrimp

**Serves** 4 to 6

4 cups water

4 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus 2 teaspoons finely grated zest, and spent halves of the lemon reserved

¼ cup chopped fresh dill, stems reserved

Kosher salt

2 teaspoons whole black peppercorns

2 pounds extra-large shrimp, shelled and deveined

⅓ cup mayonnaise

¼ cup plain whole-milk Greek yogurt

6 scallions, white and green parts thinly sliced and kept separate

Freshly ground black pepper

1 large celery rib, trimmed and finely diced

In a large saucepan, combine the water, 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice, the spent lemon halves, dill stems, 1 teaspoon salt, the peppercorns, and shrimp. Set the pan over medium-high heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are pink, barely firm, and just cooked through, and the liquid temperature reaches 170°F on an instant-read thermometer, 10 to 15 minutes.

While the shrimp poach, set a colander in the sink, and fill a large bowl with ice water and set aside. Drain the poached shrimp in the colander, then, working quickly, transfer them to the ice water, leaving behind the lemon halves, dill stems, and peppercorns. Empty the colander, discarding its contents, and drain the shrimp again. Blot them dry with paper towels, and halve them lengthwise.

In a large bowl, combine the mayonnaise, yogurt, scallion whites, chopped dill, lemon zest, remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper and whisk to incorporate. Add the shrimp and celery and fold to coat with the dressing. Cover and refrigerate so the flavors meld, about 2 hours.

Add most of the scallion greens to the shrimp and fold to combine. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Sprinkle with the remaining scallion greens before serving.

## Tika's Honey Mead

**Serves** 2

Small ice cubes for shaking

4 ounces off-dry (almost dry), traditional-style mead (such as Oliver Winery and Vineyards Camelot Mead)

2 ounces fresh orange juice

1½ ounces gin (such as London dry)

1 ounce honey syrup

½ ounce fresh lemon juice

2 orange twists

To chill a cocktail glass or coupe, put it in the freezer for an hour before using.

Chill two coupes or cocktail glasses (see Cook's Note).

Fill a large cocktail shaker about halfway with ice and add the mead, orange juice, gin, honey syrup, and lemon juice. Cover and shake until blended and chilled, about 30 seconds. Strain the mixture into the chilled glasses. Run an orange twist around the rim of each glass and then drop it in before serving.

## Brackleberry Jam

**Makes** about 1¼ cups

2 cups lightly packed, chopped fresh strawberries (see Cook's Note)

½ cup fresh blueberries

½ cup fresh blackberries

½ cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar

1½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice

1 small pinch kosher salt

To chop the strawberries, hull them, cut each one in quarters lengthwise (large ones in sixths), turn the pieces 90 degrees, and cut them in half crosswise.

Place a small plate in the freezer to chill.

In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, sugar, lemon juice, and salt and bring to a strong boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Continue boiling for 5 minutes to soften the berries. Remove from the heat and, using a large slotted spoon or handheld potato masher, mash the berries thoroughly. Return to medium-high heat and continue to boil until the mixture is reduced and slightly thickened, just verging on a jammy consistency, 15 to 18 minutes longer.

Remove the plate from the freezer and drop about 1 teaspoon of the jam on it. Wait about 15 seconds and then run your finger through the jam. If it leaves a clean trail, the jam is done. If the jam runs back into the trail, return the plate to the freezer, turn the heat to medium, simmer the jam for 2 to 4 minutes longer before retesting. When the jam is done, transfer it to a heatproof jar and set aside to cool to room temperature (it will thicken as it cools). Cover with a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate for up to 3 weeks.

## Eldeen Banquet

**Serves** 4

Kosher salt

2 pounds eggplant, peeled, stem ends trimmed, and cut lengthwise into ¾-inch-thick slices

½ cup all-purpose flour

Freshly ground black pepper

2 eggs

3½ cups panko breadcrumbs

1½ teaspoons crumbled dried oregano

1½ teaspoons paprika

1½ teaspoons garlic powder

1½ teaspoons onion powder

1 pinch cayenne pepper

½ cup olive oil (not extra-virgin)

#### Sautéed Tomatoes

1½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

¼ cup minced shallot

Kosher salt

2 teaspoons pressed or grated garlic

3 cups cherry tomatoes or large grape tomatoes, halved

1 pinch granulated sugar

½ teaspoon sherry or balsamic vinegar

2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

You'll need at least two, and preferably three, baking sheets. If you don't have a third, you can use a large cutting board for the dredged eggplant slices.

Line two baking sheets with clean kitchen towels or a triple layer of paper towels.

Sprinkle 1 tablespoon salt evenly over both sides of the eggplant slices to draw out its water and arrange the eggplant in a single layer on the prepared baking sheets. Allow to drain for about 1 hour, flipping the slices halfway through. Blot the eggplant dry with another clean kitchen towel or triple layer of paper towels, pressing firmly but taking care not to crush the eggplant. Transfer to a bowl or plate, and set aside. Wash and dry the baking sheets.

With racks in the upper- and lower-middle positions, place a baking sheet on each rack, and preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a large platter or third baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

In a shallow dish, such as a pie plate, combine the flour and 1 teaspoon pepper and whisk to incorporate. In a second shallow dish, beat the eggs until uniform. In a third shallow dish, combine the panko, oregano, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, ½ teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and stir to blend.

Working with one or two eggplant slices at a time, dredge them in the flour and tap off any excess. Dip the floured slices into the egg to coat thoroughly, allowing any excess to drip into the dish. Then dredge in the panko mixture to coat thoroughly, pressing the panko onto the eggplant to help adhere. Place the slices on the prepared platter, and repeat with the remaining eggplant slices, trying not to overlap them.

Carefully remove the preheated baking sheets from the oven. Add ¼ cup of the olive oil to each sheet and, using a heatproof silicone brush, spread it out evenly. Place half the breaded eggplant slices on each baking sheet in a single layer. Bake for 20 minutes and then flip the slices, rotating the baking sheets, and swap between the racks. Continue baking until the eggplant is well browned and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes longer.

***To make the tomatoes:.*** About 10 minutes after flipping the eggplant slices, in a medium skillet over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the shallot and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring constantly, until the shallot starts to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the tomatoes, shake the pan to coat them with oil, and cook, shaking the skillet occasionally, until they soften but do not collapse completely, about 4 minutes, adding the sugar halfway through cooking. Add the vinegar and parsley and toss to distribute. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt if necessary.

Sprinkle the baked eggplant very lightly with salt. Transfer to a serving platter, spoon the tomatoes over or around the eggplant, and sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately.

## Elfharrow Baked Goat Cheese

**Serves** 6

3 ounces plain Melba toast

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

½ cup minced shallots

1 egg

2 teaspoons Dijon mustard

One 10- to 12-ounce log firm, mild goat cheese, cut into 12 equal slices (see Cook's Note)

1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar

2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice

¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing

12 cups loosely packed mixed salad greens or mesclun

1 apple or pear, cored and thinly sliced (optional)

3 tablespoons snipped fresh chives

To quickly and neatly slice the goat cheese, use a cheese slicer with a wire cutter. If you don't have one, you can use a length of dental floss, wrapping the ends around your index fingers so that it's taut.

If you prefer, you can use olive oil cooking spray to coat the frozen cheese rounds, rather than brushing them with olive oil.

In a food processor, combine the Melba toast and ½ teaspoon salt, season with pepper, and process until you have fine, uniform crumbs, about the texture of wheat germ. Add ¼ cup of the minced shallots and pulse to combine. Transfer the mixture to a shallow dish. In a second shallow dish, beat the egg and 1 teaspoon of the mustard until uniform. Dip a slice of goat cheese into the egg, covering both sides and the edges. Then dip into the Melba toast mixture, gently pressing the crumbs onto the cheese to form a thick coating, and place on a plate. Repeat with the remaining cheese slices, adding them to the plate as you go. Put the plate in the freezer and freeze until the cheese is very firm, about 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a large nonreactive bowl, combine the vinegar, lemon juice, remaining 1 teaspoon mustard, and ½ teaspoon salt; season with pepper; and whisk to incorporate. Stir in the remaining ¼ cup shallots and set aside for the flavors to blend, about 10 minutes. While whisking vigorously, add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream to blend and emulsify into a dressing. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary, and set aside.

With a rack in the upper position, preheat the oven to 475°F. Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet.

Place the frozen cheese rounds on the rack, then brush lightly all over with olive oil. Bake until the coating is deep golden brown and the cheese is slightly soft, 9 to 14 minutes. Let the cheese cool on the wire rack for about 2 minutes.

Whisk the dressing to recombine. Add the greens and apple (if using) to the dressing and toss to coat. Divide the greens among six serving plates, place two cheese rounds on each, and sprinkle with some of the chives. Serve immediately.

## Elven Flatbread

**Makes** one 13 by 9-inch focaccia

3 cups all-purpose flour or bread flour

1 packet (2¼ teaspoons) instant or Rapid Rise yeast

2 teaspoons kosher salt

1¾ cups lukewarm (105° to 115°F) water

5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature

Vegetables (such as halved cherry or grape tomatoes, sliced shallots or red onions, sliced mini bell peppers, and scallions)

Fresh herbs for garnish (such as parsley or basil sprigs)

Sliced black olives for garnish (optional)

Large-flake salt (such as Maldon)

In a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast, and kosher salt and whisk to incorporate. Make a well in the center, add the water and, using a wooden spoon or your hands, stir around the perimeter of the well to incorporate the dry ingredients into the wet, creating a mass of sticky dough (it will look a little lumpy, which is fine). Pour 1½ teaspoons of the olive oil over the dough, and turn the dough to coat lightly. Cover the bowl and refrigerate until the dough has about doubled in bulk, at least 12 hours or up to 48 hours.

A couple of hours before you're ready to bake, coat a 13 by 9-inch baking dish with the butter and then with nonstick cooking spray. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to the center of the dish and tilt to spread the oil. Pull the dough away from the sides of the bowl to deflate. Place in the prepared baking dish, roll in the oil to coat well, and re-shape it into a loose ball. Cover and let rest at room temperature until doubled in bulk, 2½ to 4 hours (timing will depend on the ambient temperature).

When ready to top and bake, with a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 425°F. Pour 2 tablespoons olive oil over the dough and spread evenly over the surface. Using your fingers, gently stretch the dough toward the edges of the pan (ideally it will come within an inch or two) while pressing into it with your fingertips to create deep dimples, though not all the way to the bottom. Arrange the vegetables on the dough decoratively in a single layer, pressing them into the dough to help adhere. Brush with the remaining 1½ teaspoons olive oil, garnish with herbs and olives (if using), and sprinkle as much flaky salt as you like evenly over the surface.

Bake the flatbread until golden brown, puffed on the top, and crisp on the bottom, 28 to 40 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Place the pan on a wire rack to cool for 15 minutes. Carefully remove the bread from the pan, transfer to the rack, and let cool until just warm. Cut and serve.

## Elverquisst

**Makes** about 1¾ quarts

¼ cup granulated sugar

¼ cup warm water

One 750 ml bottle cold inexpensive, medium-bodied, dry red wine (such as Merlot)

1½ cups apple juice

1 cup pomegranate juice

½ cup Calvados or another brandy

3 cinnamon sticks

1 cup plain seltzer, cold

1 cup large ice cubes, plus more for serving

Apple slices for garnish (optional)

In a large bowl or pitcher, combine the sugar and water and stir to dissolve the sugar. Add the wine, both juices, Calvados, and cinnamon sticks and stir. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.

When ready to serve, remove the cinnamon sticks, if desired. Add the seltzer and ice cubes and stir to blend. Pour into ice-filled punch or juice glasses, and garnish each with an apple slice, if desired.

## Fey Fritters

**Makes** about fourteen 3-inch fritters

4 cups water

Kosher salt

2 cups frozen (not thawed) or fresh green peas

2 eggs, beaten

⅓ cup whole milk, plus more as needed

⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley

¼ cup minced shallot

1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest

1 teaspoon baking powder

Freshly ground black pepper

½ cup all-purpose flour

½ cup coarsely crumbled feta

Neutral oil for panfrying

If you like, accompany the fritters with a small bowl of crème fraîche or a plain Greek yogurt accented with a little olive oil, lemon juice, chopped fresh mint or scallions, salt, and pepper.

Set a colander in the sink. Fill a large bowl with ice water and set aside. Line a plate with paper towels.

In a medium saucepan over high heat, bring the water to a rapid boil. Add ½ teaspoon salt and the peas, cover, and cook until bright green and just tender, about 2 minutes for frozen or 3 to 4 minutes for fresh (the water probably won't return to a full boil). Drain the peas in the colander and immediately place them in the ice water to stop the cooking. Drain the peas again and spread them on the prepared plate to dry. Set aside ⅓ cup.

Transfer the remaining peas to a food processor and pulse to a coarse puree, three or four 2-second pulses, then scrape the puree into a medium bowl. Add the reserved whole peas, eggs, milk, parsley, shallot, lemon zest, baking powder, and 1½ teaspoons salt; season with pepper; and stir to blend. Add the flour and, using a flexible spatula, fold it into the pea mixture. Add the feta and continue folding until no dry patches remain. This batter should be about the texture of a thick, chunky applesauce; if it's too thick, add more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, folding to incorporate until the proper texture is attained.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 250°F. Line a large plate or platter with paper towels and set aside.

In a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm 2 tablespoons neutral oil until shimmering. Gauge the oil temperature and seasoning by placing about 1 tablespoon batter in the center of the skillet and cook until the fritter is lightly browned on the bottom, about 1 minute (the oil around the fritters should bubble gently). Flip the fritter and cook until the second side is browned, about 1 minute longer. If it is too light or too dark, adjust the heat accordingly and retest. Taste and adjust the seasoning of the batter with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

Working in batches, scoop roughly 3-tablespoon portions of the batter into the pan, spreading them into 3-inch rounds, with about 1 inch between them. Cook, undisturbed, until tiny bubbles appear on the surface and the bottom is browned, 2½ to 3 minutes. Using a spatula, gently flip the fritters and cook, undisturbed, until the second side is well browned, 1½ to 2 minutes longer. Transfer the fritters to the prepared plate and place in the oven to keep warm. Repeat to cook the remaining batter, adding more oil to equal about 2 tablespoons when necessary. Serve the fritters warm, as soon as the last batch has cooked.

## Seelie Court Cheese and Potato Soup

**Makes** about 2½ quarts

3 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 large yellow onion, chopped

1 large celery rib, trimmed and chopped

2 bay leaves

Kosher salt

1½ tablespoons pressed or grated garlic

2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme

6 cups low-sodium chicken broth

1½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled and chopped

One 5.2-ounce package Boursin cheese flavored with garlic and fine herbs, crumbled and at room temperature, plus more cheese for garnish (optional)

¾ cup half-and-half

Freshly ground black pepper

¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

¼ cup snipped fresh chives

In a large saucepan or medium pot over medium-high heat, melt the butter, swirling to coat the pan. Add the onion, celery, bay leaves, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring until the vegetables are heated through, about 3 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium-low, cover, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have released their juices, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the chicken broth and potatoes, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Adjust the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are very tender, about 25 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Add the cheese, cover, and heat until the cheese softens or melts, about 2 minutes.

Remove the soup from the heat. Using an immersion blender, blend until smooth. Alternatively, let the soup cool slightly and blend in batches in a countertop blender. Return the soup to the saucepan, if necessary.

Adjust the heat to medium-low, add the half-and-half and 1 teaspoon salt, season with pepper, and warm the soup, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 4 minutes. Add the parsley and about half the chives and stir to combine. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Ladle into individual bowls and sprinkle with additional Boursin (if desired), and the remaining chives before serving.

Sliced avocado and sliced hard-boiled egg are nice accompaniments. This easily becomes a full meal when served with rice and a salad.

In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the neutral oil until shimmering. Add the onion, red bell pepper, Cubanelle pepper, Scotch bonnet, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant and a shade darker, about 1½ minutes. Add the thyme and garlic and cook, stirring until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the kippers and cook, stirring occasionally and taking care not to completely shred the fish (though it will break down some as you stir, which is fine), until heated through, about 3 minutes longer. Add most of the scallions and the lime juice and season with black pepper, stirring to incorporate.

Remove the skillet from the heat and discard the whole chile. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve immediately, sprinkling each portion with some of the remaining scallions and a lime wedge on the side.

## Fried Soy with Vegetables

**Serves** 4

One 14- to 20-ounce block firm or extra-firm tofu

3 tablespoons soy sauce

2½ tablespoons Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry

3 teaspoons toasted sesame oil

⅓ cup low-sodium chicken broth, vegetable broth, or water

1 teaspoon light brown sugar

1 teaspoon cornstarch

6 medium scallions, white parts minced and green parts cut into 1-inch lengths

1½ tablespoons minced or grated fresh ginger

1 tablespoon minced or grated garlic

¼ cup neutral oil

Three 3-ounce baby bok choy (about 5 inches long), trimmed at the base and quartered lengthwise

2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch matchsticks

1 large red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into ½-inch-wide strips

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Serve this with hot freshly cooked rice—brown or white.

Line a small baking sheet or cutting board with a clean kitchen towel or triple thickness of paper towels. Halve the tofu block lengthwise, cut each half into 1-inch-thick slices, and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Top the tofu with another clean kitchen towel or triple thickness of paper towels and a second baking sheet or small cutting board. Weight it down with a large skillet or pot (or something of similar weight) and set aside to drain for 20 minutes.

On a large shallow dish, arrange the pressed tofu slices in a single layer. In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of the rice wine, and 1½ teaspoons of the sesame oil and whisk to incorporate. Pour over the tofu, turn the slices to coat (take care not to break them), and let marinate for 15 minutes, turning them again halfway through.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce, remaining 1½ tablespoons rice wine, remaining 1½ teaspoons sesame oil, the chicken broth, brown sugar, and cornstarch; whisk to blend; and set aside. In another small bowl, combine the scallion whites, ginger, garlic, and 2 teaspoons of the neutral oil; stir to incorporate; and set aside.

In a large nonstick skillet over high heat, warm 2 teaspoons neutral oil until shimmering. Tilt the skillet to coat the bottom, add the tofu in a single layer, and cook, undisturbed, until browned on the bottom, 2½ to 3½ minutes. Turn the slices and continue cooking until browned on the second side, 2½ to 3½ minutes longer. Transfer the tofu to a large bowl, cut the slices in half, if desired, and set aside.

Return the skillet to high heat, add 2 teaspoons neutral oil, and warm until shimmering. Tilt the skillet to coat the bottom, add the bok choy, cut-side down, sprinkle lightly with salt, and cook, undisturbed, until spotted with brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Turn the pieces so the second cut side is down and continue to cook, undisturbed, until that side is spotty brown and the bok choy is barely tender, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to the bowl with the tofu.

Return the skillet to high heat, add 2 teaspoons neutral oil, and warm until shimmering. Tilt the skillet to coat the bottom; add the carrots, bell pepper, and ¼ teaspoon salt; and cook, stirring occasionally, until barely tender, about 2 minutes.

Adjust the heat to medium, clear the center of the skillet, add the remaining 4 teaspoons neutral oil, and allow it to warm for a moment. Add the ginger-garlic mixture and cook, stirring and mashing the mixture, until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Whisk the soy sauce mixture to recombine, add to the skillet, and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce is thickened, about 45 seconds.

Add the tofu, bok choy, scallion greens, and ½ teaspoon salt to the skillet and season with pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until heated through and coated with sauce, about 1 minute. Divide among four plates and serve immediately.

## Green Ice Rime

**Serves** 4

½ teaspoon neutral oil

4½ cups 1% or 2% milk

3 envelopes unflavored gelatin (2 tablespoons plus ¾ teaspoon)

⅓ cup granulated sugar

1 small pinch kosher salt

2 teaspoons mint extract

¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

3 small drops green food coloring

Glass or ceramic baking pans are your top choices here. Since you'll be cutting the gelatin right in the pan, you could easily damage the nonstick coating in a metal pan.

Using a paper towel, spread the neutral oil in an 8- or 9-inch square baking pan, coating the bottom and sides and leaving a slight film. Set aside.

Pour 1½ cups of the milk into a wide bowl, sprinkle the gelatin evenly over the surface, and allow to soften, about 10 minutes.

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm the remaining 3 cups milk, the sugar, and salt, stirring to dissolve the sugar, until warm to the touch, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the gelatin mixture, and whisk until the gelatin dissolves. Let cool for about 10 minutes. Add the mint extract, vanilla, and food coloring and stir to incorporate. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours and no more than 2 days.

When ready to serve, cut the gelatin into 2-inch squares and transfer to chilled dessert goblets or sundae dishes.

## Loaf Pudding

**Makes** one 8½ by 4½-inch loaf

#### Loaf

1⅓ cups all-purpose flour

⅔ cup almond meal

2 teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon kosher salt

8 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into chunks

¾ cup granulated sugar

3 eggs

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

½ teaspoon almond extract

½ cup plain yogurt (preferably whole-milk)

3 tablespoons sliced almonds

#### Syrup

¼ cup granulated sugar

3 tablespoons water

1 small pinch kosher salt

½ teaspoon vanilla extract

¼ teaspoon almond extract

A bamboo skewer is ideal for poking holes in the loaf.

The loaf has a fragile crumb, made more so by the syrup, so use a serrated knife to slice it as neatly as you can.

***To make the loaf:.*** With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 350°F. Coat an 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat, place a wire rack on top, and set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, almond meal, baking powder, and salt; whisk to incorporate; and set aside.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or with a handheld mixer, on medium-high speed, beat the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a flexible spatula once or twice. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla and almond extract, beat well, and scrape down the sides of the bowl again.

Adjust the mixer speed to low. Add about one-third of the flour mixture, followed by half of the yogurt, mixing after each addition until just incorporated, about 5 seconds. Repeat with half of the remaining flour mixture, followed by all the remaining yogurt. Scrape down the sides of the bowl again and add the remaining flour mixture. Adjust the speed to medium-low and mix just until the batter is smooth (do not overmix).

Using a flexible spatula, scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan, smooth the top, and sprinkle the sliced almonds down the center, pressing them lightly to help adhere.

Bake the loaf until the top is browned, the edges begin to pull away from the pan, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes (do not overbake), rotating the pan halfway through. Let the loaf cool in the pan for 8 minutes. Loosen the sides of the loaf and carefully turn it out (the pan will still be hot) onto the prepared rack and set right-side up.

***To make the syrup:.*** In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, water, and salt and bring to a steamy simmer, constantly swirling the pan to dissolve the sugar, about 3 minutes. Continue simmering until glossy bubbles develop and the liquid is slightly thickened, about 3 minutes longer. Let the syrup cool to room temperature, add the vanilla and almond extract, and swirl to incorporate them.

While the loaf is still hot, use a long, thin skewer to poke deep holes (but don't go all the way through) on its bottom and sides, as well as along both sides of the almonds on top. Brush the syrup over the holes all over the loaf, working slowly to allow it to be absorbed. Return the loaf to the rack to cool to room temperature, if necessary. Slice and serve. Wrap in plastic wrap and store at room temperature for up to 2 days.

## Spiced Pork and Orange Peppers

**Serves** 4

½ teaspoon paprika

½ teaspoon ground coriander

½ teaspoon ground fennel

½ teaspoon garlic powder

¼ teaspoon ground cumin

⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper (or more if you like it hot)

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 large pork tenderloin (1½ pounds), silverskin removed (see Cook's Note), and patted dry with paper towels

3 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

1 large yellow onion, halved from pole to pole and sliced lengthwise

4 large orange bell peppers, cored, seeded, and cut into ¾-inch-wide strips

5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced

1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme

2 teaspoons sherry, cider, or wine vinegar, plus more as needed

⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley

Silverskin is a light-colored (silvery) membrane on the meat that contracts when cooked. It can be removed with a sharp paring knife.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 425°F.

In a small bowl, combine the paprika, coriander, fennel, garlic powder, cumin, cayenne, ¾ teaspoon salt, and ¾ teaspoon black pepper and stir to incorporate. Rub the pork with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, then sprinkle the spice mixture all over the meat, rubbing it into the surface.

In a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon olive oil until shimmering. Add the pork, adjust the heat to medium, and cook until browned all over, giving it a quarter turn every 1½ minutes (adjusting the heat as necessary if the pan drippings threaten to scorch) until all four sides are cooked, about 6 minutes total. Transfer the tenderloin to a plate and set aside.

Return the skillet to medium heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, and let warm for a moment (taking care not to scorch the caramelized bits left in the skillet). Add the onion, bell peppers, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release the caramelized bits as the vegetables release moisture, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking until the vegetables just begin to soften, about 3 minutes longer. Add the garlic and thyme and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Return the pork to the skillet, positioning it over the vegetables.

Place the skillet in the oven and roast the meat until the center registers 140°F on an instant-read thermometer, 12 to 17 minutes, turning the tenderloin over midway through cooking. Transfer the tenderloin to a carving board, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 145° to 150°F, 5 to 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, turn off the oven and return the skillet with its vegetables to the oven to keep warm.

When the meat has almost finished resting, remove the skillet from the oven. Stir in the vinegar and most of the parsley. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, then scrape the vegetables onto a serving platter. Cut the pork on the diagonal into slices about ½ inch thick and arrange them over the vegetables. Sprinkle lightly with salt, pepper, and the remaining parsley before serving.

## Steak of the Deep

**Serves** 4

⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling

1 medium yellow onion, chopped

1 bay leaf

Kosher salt

3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced

1½ teaspoons paprika

½ cup Amontillado or Fino sherry, plus 2 teaspoons

One 14½-ounce can petite-diced tomatoes

Freshly ground black pepper

1½ pounds swordfish steak, about 1 inch thick

¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

If the sauce cools to room temperature and becomes too thick and sticky, set the pan over medium-low heat until it's warm and viscous again.

In a braising pan or large sauté pan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the onion, bay leaf, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the onion starts to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and paprika and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Add the ½ cup sherry, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a strong simmer. Let simmer, stirring, for about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and ¾ teaspoon salt and season with pepper. Return to a simmer and cook, stirring, to blend the flavors, about 3 minutes.

Sprinkle the swordfish on both sides with salt and pepper and nestle it into the tomato mixture. Adjust the heat to low, cover, and cook until the swordfish is opaque, just firm to the touch, and registers 130°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 25 minutes, turning it over halfway through cooking. Transfer the swordfish to a serving platter, leaving the sauce in the pan. Tent the fish loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, adjust the heat to medium-high and bring the sauce to a strong simmer. Add most of the parsley and the remaining 2 teaspoons sherry, and stir to blend. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

Top the swordfish with the tomato sauce, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with the remaining parsley before serving.

## Tamarind Balls

**Makes** 18 tamarind balls

6 ounces tamarind pulp (see Cook's Note)

¼ cup tightly packed, quartered pitted dates (quartered lengthwise)

¼ cup granulated sugar, plus more as needed

½ teaspoon vanilla extract

1 pinch kosher salt

3 tablespoons large-crystal sugar (such as Turbinado or Demerara)

Rectangular blocks of tamarind pulp are available at many international markets. Often the package says that the pulp is seedless, but that's not always the case. Make sure there are no seeds before adding the pulp to the food processor.

Large-crystal sugar, such as Demerara, Turbinado, or Trader Joe's organic cane sugar, makes a particularly pretty coating, but you can certainly use regular granulated sugar.

Using your fingers, break up the tamarind pulp into very small bits, feeling for whole seeds or large fragments and removing any that you discover. Transfer to a food processor or mini chopper. Add the dates, granulated sugar, vanilla, and salt and process or chop until the ingredients are combined and very finely chopped, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to a small bowl.

Place the large-crystal sugar in a wide, shallow bowl. Roll 2-teaspoon portions of the tamarind mixture into eighteen scant 1-inch balls, gently pressing as you roll to help them cohere. Working with three or four balls at a time, roll them in the crystal sugar, pressing gently to help it adhere. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days.

## Tavern Noodles

**Serves** 4 to 6

⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil

3 large onions, halved from pole to pole and thinly sliced lengthwise

Kosher salt

1½ teaspoons minced fresh rosemary or thyme

2 teaspoons pressed or grated garlic

½ cup dry white wine

12 ounces fettuccine, tagliatelle, or pappardelle

¾ cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving

Freshly ground black pepper

⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley

3 hard-cooked eggs, peeled and chopped

In a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm 3 tablespoons of the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onions and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and light gold, about 30 minutes. Add the rosemary and 1 teaspoon of the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the wine, adjust the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced by half, about 2½ minutes.

While the onions are cooking, in a large pot over high heat, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add 1 tablespoon salt and the fettuccine and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until just barely al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot. Adjust the heat to medium-low, add the onion mixture to the pasta, toss, and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat, add the remaining 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon olive oil, remaining 1 teaspoon garlic, the Parmesan, and 1 teaspoon salt. Season with pepper and toss well. Add between ½ cup and 1 cup of the reserved cooking water to loosen the sauce and distribute the ingredients evenly. Add most of the parsley and toss. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary, and transfer the pasta into a serving dish. Sprinkle with the chopped egg and remaining parsley before serving.

## Tears of Selûne

**Serves** 4

3/10 cup mirin

3 tablespoons sake

3 tablespoons soy sauce

2 tablespoons granulated sugar

1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional)

1½ pounds firm white fish fillets (such as sea bass), cut into roughly 1-inch cubes

2 tablespoons neutral oil

Hot freshly cooked rice for serving

1 large scallion (white and light green parts), thinly sliced

1 tablespoon sesame seeds, lightly toasted (see Cook's Note, this page) and cooled

In a medium skillet over medium heat, combine the mirin, sake, soy sauce, sugar, and paprika (if using) and bring to a steamy simmer, swirling the skillet to dissolve the sugar. Once a few bubbles form around the edges, continue simmering, swirling the pan occasionally, until tight, glossy, foamy bubbles cover most of the surface, about 5½ minutes. Remove from the heat and let the mixture cool until just warm and thickened to the consistency of a loose glaze, 5 to 6 minutes.

Preheat the grill to medium-high.

Thread the cubed fish onto metal or pre-soaked bamboo skewers. Drizzle with oil and gently turn to coat. Once the grill is hot, cook the fish skewers until cooked through and lightly charred, 6 to 8 minutes, turning them over halfway through cooking. Just before removing the fish from the grill, gently brush it all over with the glaze.

Spoon a portion of rice onto each of four serving plates or bowls. Arrange the fish skewers over the rice, then sprinkle each portion with the scallions and sesame seeds. Serve immediately.

## Trencher Bread

**Serves** 2

2 cups whole-wheat flour

¾ cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting

¼ cup stone-ground cornmeal

2½ teaspoons kosher salt

2½ teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon baking soda

1¼ cups whole milk or low-fat Greek yogurt (not nonfat)

⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil

3 tablespoons neutral oil

Brushing the breads with extra-virgin olive oil or melted butter while they're still warm is a nice touch.

Lightly flour a work surface. In a large bowl, combine the whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, cornmeal, salt, baking powder, and baking soda and whisk to incorporate. Make a well in the center, add the milk and olive oil, and, using a wooden spoon or your hands, stir around the perimeter of the well to incorporate the dry ingredients into the wet (the dough will look a little rough and shaggy). Scrape the dough onto the prepared work surface and knead until smooth and uniform, dusting with a tiny amount of all-purpose flour as you go if the dough becomes too sticky. Divide the dough into four equal portions. Gently roll each portion into a ball, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let rest for 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 125°F.

Using a rolling pin, roll out one of the dough balls into a circle with an 11-inch diameter. In a 12-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium heat, warm about 2 teaspoons of the neutral oil until hot. Tilt the skillet to coat the bottom with oil, carefully place the dough circle in the skillet, and cook, undisturbed, until spotted with brown on the bottom and slightly puffed, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the round over and continue to cook, undisturbed, until the second side is spotty brown as well, 3 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer the bread to a baking sheet or ovenproof plate and place it in the oven to keep warm. One at a time, roll and cook the remaining rounds, adding the remaining 1 tablespoon neutral oil and adjusting the heat if necessary to avoid burning, and transferring them to the oven keep warm. Serve immediately.

## Undermountain Alurlyath

**Serves** 2

One 1-pound English or standard cucumber, scrubbed but not peeled

2 ounces Amontillado sherry

1 ounce honey syrup

1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

Small ice cubes

6 ounces plain seltzer, cold

Stirring in the cucumber juice, rather than shaking it with the other ingredients, prevents it from becoming too frothy.

Cut the cucumber in half crosswise, then cut two thin slices from the cut side of one half and reserve them for garnish. Chop the rest of the cucumber halves and transfer to a food processor. Process into a liquidy pulp, about 10 seconds, stopping once to scrape down the sides of the work bowl.

Line a medium bowl with a clean kitchen towel. Scrape the cucumber pulp into the center, gather the edges and corners of the towel, and, working over the bowl, squeeze and twist hard to wring out as much liquid as possible. Compost the pulp or reserve for another use.

Fill a cocktail shaker with the sherry, honey syrup, and lemon juice. Cover and shake to blend, about 10 seconds. Remove the cover, add 1 cup of the cucumber juice, and stir to combine.

Fill two rocks or wine glasses about halfway with ice, add half the sherry-cucumber mixture to each, top each with 3 ounces seltzer, and stir gently. Garnish each drink with a reserved cucumber slice before serving.

---

## Butternut Beer

**Serves** 2

Large ice cubes

3 ounces rye or bourbon

1½ ounces butterscotch schnapps

2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice

6 drops bitters (such as Angostura)

4 ounces plain seltzer, cold

8 ounces cream soda, cold

2 lemon slices

To frost the mugs, put in the freezer for an hour before using.

Fill two frosted mugs about halfway with ice. To each, add 1½ ounces rye, ¾ ounce schnapps, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, and 3 drops bitters and stir to blend and chill. Add 2 ounces seltzer and 4 ounces cream soda to each mug, and again stir gently to blend.

Garnish each drink with a lemon slice before serving.

## Chopforest

**Serves** 4 to 6

1 pound green cabbage, finely shredded

Kosher salt

¼ cup Kalamata olives, pitted and finely chopped

1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar

1½ teaspoons finely grated lemon zest

1 teaspoon pressed or grated garlic

Freshly ground black pepper

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

1 medium fennel bulb, trimmed, cored, and thinly sliced, plus about 1½ tablespoons chopped fronds

4 medium scallions, trimmed; whites thinly sliced and greens cut into ½-inch lengths

⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley

You can substitute thinly shaved fresh brussels sprouts for some or all of the cabbage if you'd like. It will decrease the yield a bit, as brussels sprouts leaves are more delicate than cabbage, and they compact more once dressed. If you use shaved brussels sprouts, there's no need to salt and rest them.

In a colander or large strainer set over a medium bowl, toss the cabbage with 2 teaspoons salt. Let the cabbage rest until slightly wilted, at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours. Rinse the cabbage well under very cold running water, drain thoroughly, and dry very well with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Scrape the cabbage into a large bowl and fluff it with your fingers (it can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days).

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the olives, vinegar, lemon zest, garlic, and ½ teaspoon salt; season with pepper; and whisk to incorporate. While whisking vigorously, add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream to combine and emulsify into a dressing.

Add the cabbage, fennel bulb, scallions, and parsley to the bowl and toss to combine. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary, and sprinkle with the fennel fronds before serving.

## Goldenstars

**Makes** about 15 pastries

#### Dough

2½ cups all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons granulated sugar

1 tablespoon onion powder

½ teaspoon baking powder

1 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

2 eggs

½ cup neutral oil

¼ cup water

#### Filling

1½ teaspoons neutral oil

1 four-ounce mild-flavored fresh sausage, casing removed (see Cook's Note)

¾ cup diced (about ⅜-inch cubes) peeled Yukon gold potato

¼ cup water

Kosher salt

1 tablespoon unsalted butter

1¼ cups loosely packed very thinly sliced leeks (white and light green parts; halved lengthwise before slicing)

1½ teaspoons chopped fresh thyme

1½ tablespoons all-purpose flour

¾ cup low-sodium chicken broth

Freshly ground black pepper

¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

#### Egg Wash

1 egg

1 tablespoon water

Fresh sausages come in a variety of sizes and flavors. Choose a mild flavor such as spinach or roasted garlic and steer clear of strong, spicy, or smoky flavors. Turkey sausage is fine here, if you prefer it.

If you don't have a 4-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, you can use a small dish 4 inches in diameter with a thin rim to cut the dough rounds.

A bench scraper is a useful and inexpensive tool. You can use it to level flour in a measuring cup, or batter in a baking pan, in addition to loosening dough from a work surface.

Goldenstars can be wrapped in aluminum foil and refrigerated for up to 4 days. Before serving, reheat in a 350°F oven, still wrapped in foil, until warmed through, about 30 minutes.

***To make the dough:.*** In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, onion powder, baking powder, salt, and pepper and whisk together. In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, neutral oil, and water and whisk until uniform. Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture and, using a flexible spatula, fold until incorporated into a dough.

Turn the dough onto a work surface and knead briefly until it comes together. Divide in half and pat each half into a roughly 6-inch disc. Place the discs side by side in the bowl or on a plate, cover with a kitchen towel, and let rest for about 1 hour.

***To make the filling:.*** Line a small plate with a paper towel and set aside.

In a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm the neutral oil. Add the sausage and cook, stirring and breaking it into small crumbles, until it no longer appears raw, about 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to the prepared plate, leaving as much of the rendered fat in the skillet as possible.

Return the skillet to medium heat. Add the potato, water, and 1 pinch salt and cook, covered, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until the potato starts to soften, about 6 minutes. Add the butter and let melt, swirling to coat the pan. Add the leek, thyme, and 1 pinch salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Slowly add the chicken broth, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the skillet to dissolve the browned bits, and cook until thickened, about 1½ minutes (the texture will be quite thick, almost like loose mashed potatoes). Add the reserved sausage and stir to incorporate. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the mixture cool until barely warm, 10 to 15 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Stir in the parsley.

With racks in the upper- and lower-middle positions, preheat the oven to 375°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick baking mats, and set aside.

***To make the egg wash:.*** In a small bowl, whisk the egg and water until uniformly yellow. Set aside.

On a generously floured work surface, roll out one of the dough discs into a roughly 12-inch circle no more ¼ inch thick. Using a 4-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out four or five rounds. Gather the dough scraps into a mass, return to the bowl or plate, and cover.

If necessary, use a bench scraper to gently loosen the dough rounds from the work surface. Place about 1½ tablespoons of the filling in the center of each round. Lightly brush the edges of each round with the egg wash. Working with one at a time, form a triangle by folding three "sides" up and over the filling, leaving about 1 inch of filling uncovered. Pinch the edges together well (so they won't come apart as they bake). Place on a prepared baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.

Clean the work surface, if necessary, flour it generously, and repeat the process with the second dough disc, rolling the dough, cutting, filling, shaping, and sealing the rounds. Add the collected scraps to those from the first disc.

Clean the work surface, if necessary. Knead the collected dough scraps into a cohesive mass, pat it into a roughly 6-inch disc, cover, and let rest for about 15 minutes. Flour the work surface generously, and roll out, cut, fill, shape, and seal about five to seven final rounds. Transfer the pastries to the prepared baking sheets. Brush the three sides of the pastries (but not the exposed filling) with egg wash.

Bake the goldenstars until light golden and the filling is bubbling, about 25 minutes, swapping and rotating the baking sheets halfway through. Let the pastries cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes, then transfer them to wire racks and let cool until barely warm or room temperature before serving.

## Hot River Crab Bites

**Serves** 4

6 ounces high-quality crabmeat (see Cook's Note), drained

1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest (see Cook's Note)

½ teaspoon kosher salt

Freshly ground black pepper

¼ cup crème fraîche

⅓ cup finely chopped fresh chives

2 endives, root ends trimmed and larger outer leaves separated (see Cook's Note)

Some markets sell freshly picked crabmeat in the seafood department or containers of pasteurized crabmeat in a refrigerated case near packaged smoked salmon, herring, and other fish. Both are more flavorful choices than the canned crabmeat you may find near the canned tuna and sardines.

Zest the lemon before squeezing the juice, as it's easier to zest intact fruit.

In case you're not familiar with endive, they are small, pale, torpedo-shaped heads of lettuce (really, a type of chicory) with a pleasant, mildly bitter flavor. If you can't find or don't like endive, you can serve the crab on crackers, cucumber slices, or lightly toasted slices of baguette.

Blot the crabmeat dry with a paper towel, if necessary, and pick over for shell fragments. Transfer to a small bowl, and add the lemon juice and ¼ teaspoon of the salt; season with pepper; and stir to incorporate. Add the crème fraîche, lemon zest, remaining ¼ teaspoon salt, and most of the chives; season with additional pepper; and stir gently to mix. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

Scoop about 1 tablespoon of the crab mixture into each of sixteen endive leaves, arrange them on a platter, and sprinkle with the remaining chives. Serve immediately.

## Laumberry Pie

**Serves** 2

2 frozen piecrusts (for one double-crust pie), thawed according to the package directions until cooler than room temperature and pliable

7 cups mixed fresh blackberries and blueberries, rinsed and very gently dried with paper towels

½ to ⅔ cup granulated sugar (depending on the berries' sweetness)

3½ tablespoons cornstarch

¼ teaspoon kosher salt

1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

½ teaspoon vanilla extract

⅓ cup apple or red currant jelly

1 cup fresh raspberries, rinsed and very gently dried with paper towels

Four 5-inch pie plates

You'll need four 5-inch pie plates.

On a floured work surface or sheet of parchment paper, roll out one of the piecrusts into an oval about 14 inches long and 7 inches wide. Cut out two 7-inch circles of dough and fit each into individual 5-inch pie plates. Fold under any overhanging dough to be even with the edge of the rim. Place your thumb and index finger on the folded edge of crust and press between them with the index finger of your other hand. Work your way around the crust in this manner to create a decorative wavy rim. Repeat with the second piecrust. Cover the dough-lined plates with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for about 30 minutes.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 350°F.

Place the partially frozen dough-lined plates on a rimmed baking sheet. Line the doughs with aluminum foil, and fill with pie weights, making sure there are enough to reach most of the way up the sides.

Bake the crusts until the edges are set and just beginning to turn golden, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through. Carefully remove the foil and weights and continue baking until the crusts are light golden brown and crisp, about 12 minutes longer, again rotating the baking sheet halfway through (cover the edges of the crusts with foil if they begin to darken too much). Transfer the piecrusts to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature.

Place 2 cups of the mixed blackberries and blueberries in a medium bowl and set aside.

In a food processor, puree the remaining 5 cups mixed blackberries and blueberries until broken down and smooth, about 1 minute. Strain the puree through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium nonreactive saucepan (such as stainless steel), scraping and pressing on the solids to extract as much puree as possible, and scraping the puree off the bottom of the strainer into the saucepan. In a small bowl, combine ½ cup sugar, the cornstarch, and salt and whisk to incorporate; then whisk that mixture into the berry puree. Taste and add the remaining sugar, if necessary.

Set the saucepan over medium heat and bring the berry mixture to a strong simmer, stirring and scraping the pan bottom constantly. Cook until the mixture is thickened and pudding-like and bubbles start to break the surface, about 20 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the lemon juice and vanilla, and whisk to combine. Let the puree cool slightly.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat, warm the apple jelly until runny, stirring to smooth out lumps. Drizzle the melted jelly over the reserved blackberries and blueberries and toss gently to coat. Add the raspberries and toss very gently to coat and mix with the other berries.

Scrape one-fourth of the slightly cooled berry puree into each cooled piecrust, and top each with ¾ cup of the glazed fresh berries. Loosely cover the pies with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until chilled and the puree has set, about 3 hours or up to 1 day, before serving.

## Mingari-Spiced Owlbear Milk

**Serves** 2

½ cup old-fashioned oats

1 cup water

4 cups milk (see Cook's Note), plus more as needed

2½ tablespoons granulated sugar

1½ tablespoons light brown sugar

1 pinch kosher salt

3 cinnamon sticks, plus ground cinnamon for sprinkling

Any type of milk—from skim to whole—is fine, depending on how rich a drink you want. If you fancy a light, tangy drink, substitute ⅓ cup buttermilk for the same amount of regular milk.

In a dry medium saucepan over medium heat, toast the oatmeal, stirring constantly, until very fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes (take care to avoid burning it). Remove from the heat, add the water (it will spatter), and gently swirl the pan. Add the milk, both sugars, salt, and cinnamon sticks and stir to mix. Return the pan to medium heat and bring to a low, steamy simmer, stirring often, about 7 minutes. Adjust the heat to low and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until cooked through and soft, about 5 minutes. (If the mixture threatens to boil over, remove the pan from the heat until the foam recedes and then continue.) Remove the pan from the heat and let the mixture cool to room temperature. Scrape into a large wide-mouth jar with a tight-fitting lid, seal, and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.

Remove the mixture from the refrigerator. Remove and reserve the cinnamon sticks. Scrape the mixture into a blender (keep the jar handy) and blend on high speed until as uniform and smooth as possible. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer back into the jar, working it with a flexible spatula until just a couple of teaspoons of oat paste remain. Discard the paste, return the cinnamon sticks to the jar, cover, and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.

Remove the jar from the refrigerator and vigorously shake it. Adjust the consistency of the mixture, if desired, by adding up to ¾ cup milk, ¼ cup at a time, shaking after each addition to blend. Remove the cinnamon sticks and pour the milk into glasses (over ice, if desired). Sprinkle each with ground cinnamon before serving.

## Neverwinter Nectar

**Makes** about 1¾ quarts

2 large juicy oranges, scrubbed

1 large juicy lemon, scrubbed

3 tablespoons granulated sugar

1 cup apple juice

½ cup brandy

One 750 ml bottle inexpensive white wine, chilled (not oaked; see Cook's Note)

1 apple, washed well

1 cup seltzer, cold

1 cup small ice cubes, plus more for serving

Good choices for the white wine include dry Riesling, Gewürztraminer, Grüner Veltliner, Pinot Grigio (or Gris), or Sauvignon Blanc. Wines with oaky notes aren't great here, so steer clear of Chardonnay, which may or may not be oaked.

Quarter one of the oranges and the lemon, cutting them from the stem end to the blossom end. Cut the quarters crosswise into thin slices and place in a sturdy container. Add the sugar, stir, and set aside until the fruit softens a little, about 20 minutes. Using a potato masher, muddler, or wooden spoon, mash and muddle the mixture until the fruit releases its juice, the skins are bruised, and the juices and sugar become syrupy. Add the apple juice, brandy, and wine; stir; then cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.

Set a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl. Strain the mixture, using a sturdy spoon to press on and work the solids to exude as much liquid as possible. Discard or compost the solids and pour the liquid into a serving pitcher. Quarter the remaining orange, again cutting from the stem end to the blossom end, and thinly slice the quarters crosswise. Add to the pitcher. Quarter and core the apple, and thinly slice the quarters crosswise. Add to the pitcher, along with the seltzer and ice cubes and stir to blend. Serve over ice.

## Onion Loaf

**Makes** one 9-inch loaf

5 tablespoons unsalted butter

1½ teaspoons neutral oil

1 medium yellow onion, chopped

Kosher salt

1 small leek (white and light green parts), halved lengthwise and thinly sliced

2 cups whole-wheat flour

1 cup all-purpose flour

1½ tablespoons onion powder

2½ teaspoons baking powder

¼ teaspoon baking soda

2 eggs

1 tablespoon light brown sugar

¾ cup buttermilk

¾ cup thinly sliced scallions (white and green parts)

An oval baking dish helps the loaf keep an oblong, grublike shape as it bakes and expands.

Some of the onion mixture will burn in the dish and may stick to the bottom of the loaf, but you can just brush off any burnt bits.

The onion loaf can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 2 days.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 375°F.

In a small skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter with the neutral oil. Add the onion and ¾ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent and starting to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the leek and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes longer. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and set aside to cool.

Return the skillet to medium heat and melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter. Remove from the heat and pour about 1 tablespoon of the melted butter into a 10- to 11-inch oval gratin dish (preferably enameled cast iron). With a pastry brush, coat the inside of the dish with the butter and set aside. Reserve the remaining melted butter in the skillet.

In a large bowl, combine both flours, the onion powder, baking powder, baking soda, and 1¼ teaspoons salt and whisk together. In another large bowl, whisk together the eggs and brown sugar. Add the buttermilk to the egg mixture and whisk to combine. Add the dry mixture and, using a flexible spatula, fold and stir until nearly incorporated. Add the reserved melted butter and the scallions and continue to fold and stir until all the ingredients come together to form a lumpy dough. Knead a couple of times in the bowl, if necessary.

Scrape the dough into the prepared dish, shape into an 8-inch log, and spread the reserved onion mixture evenly over the top and sides, pressing into the dough to help it adhere.

Bake the loaf until it is firm to the touch on top, a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, and the onion mixture on the surface is browned with some crisp edges, 45 to 50 minutes, rotating halfway through. Let cool in the gratin dish for about 10 minutes, then transfer the bread to a wire rack to cool to room temperature. Slice with a serrated knife before serving.

## Rothé Steak

**Serves** 4

Two 1-pound boneless strip steaks (see Cook's Note), 1½ to 2 inches thick

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon neutral oil

3 tablespoons unsalted butter

2 garlic cloves, crushed and peeled

8 large sprigs fresh thyme or rosemary

Cast iron is the skillet of choice here because it retains heat so well.

This cooking technique is a bit messy—the fat splatters in the intense heat, and a splatter screen is of no help because of the frequent turning. The entire process moves fast, so turn on your exhaust fan and have your tongs, basting spoon, and thermometer at hand before you start cooking. And, of course, use oven mitts when handling the screaming-hot skillet.

Depending on where you live, strip steak may be called shell steak, sirloin strip steak, New York strip steak, Kansas City strip steak, or Texas strip steak, among other names. Whatever name it goes by, make sure it's thick.

A large-flake, crunchy salt, like Maldon, is a terrific finish at serving time.

Using paper towels, pat the steaks dry and season generously with salt and pepper on both sides and along the edges. Place the steaks on a plate and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour. (Or refrigerate, loosely covered, for up to 2 days. Return the steaks to room temperature before cooking.)

Set a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 7 minutes (the pan may smoke a bit). Adjust the heat to high, add the neutral oil, and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan (the oil will smoke too). Add the steaks and cook, flipping them every 30 seconds, until a pale golden crust begins to form on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes.

Adjust the heat to medium-high, slide the steaks to one side of the skillet, add the butter to the other side, and allow it to melt and foam slightly. Add the garlic and thyme to the butter. Tilt the pan toward the butter so that it pools opposite the steaks and, while continuing to flip the steaks every 30 seconds, use a long-handled, large metal spoon to baste them with the butter and aromatics, concentrating on spots that are lighter and less crusted. (If the butter smokes or the steaks begin to burn, lower the heat slightly.) Cook, basting and flipping the steaks, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest spot registers 120° to 125°F for medium-rare, about 7 minutes longer, or about 130°F for medium, 8 to 9 minutes longer.

Transfer the steaks to a carving board, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice the steaks against the grain into roughly ½-inch-thick slices before serving.

## Sornstag

**Serves** 4

¼ cup fine breadcrumbs

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

4 garlic cloves; 2 peeled and left whole, 2 pressed or grated

½ cup slivered almonds

2½ pounds venison chuck or rump, cut into 1½-inch pieces

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

About 4 teaspoons neutral oil

2 large yellow onions, chopped

2 bay leaves

2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme, or 1 teaspoon dried

½ teaspoon ground cinnamon

⅛ teaspoon ground cloves

¾ cup dry red wine

¾ cup low-sodium chicken broth

1 teaspoon cocoa powder (preferably Dutch-processed)

⅔ cup chopped fresh parsley

Line a plate with paper towels.

In a large sauté pan or Dutch oven over medium heat, toast the breadcrumbs, stirring constantly, until fragrant and a shade darker, about 3 minutes. Scrape the breadcrumbs into a small bowl, and carefully wipe out the pan.

Add the olive oil and whole garlic to the pan, return it to medium heat, and cook, undisturbed, for 1 minute. Add the almonds and cook, stirring constantly, until browned and fragrant, about 1 minute (be vigilant, as they can burn quickly). With a slotted spoon, scoop the almonds and garlic onto the prepared plate to drain. Add the garlic and ⅓ cup of the almonds to the breadcrumbs; reserve the remaining almonds separately. Pour the oil from the pan into a small bowl and set aside. Carefully wipe out the pan.

Sprinkle the venison all over with 1½ teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Set the pan over medium-high heat, add 2 teaspoons of the neutral oil, and warm until shimmering. Add about one-third of the venison, so the pieces are close together in a single layer, but not touching, and cook, undisturbed, until well browned on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Turn the pieces and cook, undisturbed, until the second side is well browned, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer the venison to a large bowl. Repeat to brown the remaining meat in one or two batches, adding more oil if needed, and adjusting the heat as necessary to avoid scorching. Transfer to the bowl with the first batch.

Set the sauté pan over medium heat, add the reserved olive oil, and allow it to warm for a moment. Add the onions, bay leaves, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any caramelized bits, until softened, about 6 minutes. Add the pressed garlic, cinnamon, and cloves and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the wine, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a strong simmer, again scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any caramelized bits. Add the chicken broth and venison with any accumulated juices, stir to combine, and return to a strong simmer. Cover the pan, adjust the heat to medium-low to maintain a bare simmer, and let simmer until the venison is tender, about 2 hours.

Using a small liquid measuring cup or mug, scoop about ½ cup of the cooking liquid from the pan. Add the cocoa powder and stir until uniform. Pour the cocoa mixture back into the pan, add ½ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper, and stir to combine.

With the same measuring cup or mug, scoop another ½ cup of cooking liquid from the pan and transfer to a blender. Add the reserved breadcrumb-almond mixture and about ¼ cup of the parsley and blend until the nuts are pulverized and the mixture is thick and very smooth, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down the sides of the blender jar at least once during that time. Scrape the mixture into the pan, stir to combine thoroughly, and partially cover the pan. Continue to cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan occasionally, until the stew is thickened, 15 to 25 minutes longer. Remove the bay leaves if desired, add about ⅓ cup parsley, and stir to combine. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Divide the sornstag among individual bowls, sprinkle each with a few of the reserved toasted almonds and some parsley. Serve immediately.

## Sour Cream-Walnut Cake

**Makes** one 8-inch square cake

#### Topping

⅓ cup all-purpose flour

¼ cup granulated sugar

¼ cup packed light brown sugar

½ teaspoon ground cinnamon

¼ teaspoon kosher salt

⅔ cup walnut pieces, toasted lightly (see Cook's Note) and cooled

5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled

#### Cake

1 cup walnut pieces, toasted lightly and cooled

2 cups all-purpose flour

2½ teaspoons instant espresso powder

1½ teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon baking soda

¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon

1 teaspoon kosher salt

2 eggs

1 cup sour cream

½ cup neutral oil

1½ teaspoons vanilla extract

½ cup granulated sugar

⅔ cup packed light brown sugar

To toast nuts or seeds, warm a heavy skillet over medium heat until hot. Add the nuts or seeds and spread out in a single layer. Cook, stirring constantly, until they are fragrant and as brown as desired.

The cake can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 2 days.

***To make the topping:.*** In a food processor, combine the flour, both sugars, cinnamon, and salt. Scatter the walnuts on top and drizzle the melted butter over the mixture. Pulse until the mixture just begins to resemble a wet, coarse sand, about three 2-second pulses (do not overprocess and pulverize the nuts). Scrape the mixture onto a plate (no need to clean the work bowl, as you'll use it again) and refrigerate for 20 minutes.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 350°F. Coat an 8-inch square baking pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.

In the food processor, pulse the walnuts with ¼ cup of the flour until the walnuts are coarsely ground, about five 2-second pulses. Pour the walnut mixture into a medium bowl; add the remaining 1¾ cups flour, the espresso powder, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt; and whisk to combine.

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until uniform. Add the sour cream, neutral oil, and vanilla and whisk vigorously to combine. Add both sugars and again whisk vigorously to combine. Add the flour mixture and, using a flexible spatula, fold to blend the wet and dry ingredients just until no pockets of dry ingredients remain. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, and smooth the top.

Working quickly, with your fingers, sprinkle the topping evenly over the surface, forming pea- to hazelnut-size clumps. Gently pat the topping onto the batter to help secure it.

Bake the cake until the top is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes, rotating the pan about halfway through. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature before cutting and serving.

## Talyth

**Makes** about 30 sandwiches

1¾ cups all-purpose flour

1½ cups finely grated aged Asiago cheese

1½ tablespoons onion powder

1½ tablespoons minced fresh thyme

1 tablespoon cornstarch

1½ teaspoons kosher salt

1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1 pinch cayenne pepper

8 tablespoons very cold unsalted butter, cut into 16 slices

¼ cup whole milk

One 4-inch piece summer sausage, sliced ⅛ inch thick on a slight diagonal (see Cook's Note)

When slicing the sausage, trim as necessary so the diameter is a little smaller than the 2½-inch diameter of the dough, to ensure the slices fit together nicely.

If you prefer, you can substitute another type of fully cooked sausage, such as Portuguese-style chouriço. Avoid cured, dried styles of sausage, which can turn leathery and tough as the talyth bake.

In a food processor, combine the flour, cheese, onion powder, thyme, cornstarch, salt, black pepper, and cayenne and process for about 15 seconds. Scatter the butter slices over the flour mixture and pulse to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture has the texture of wet sand, about twelve 3-second pulses. With the motor running, add the milk through the feed tube and process until a dough just comes together, about 30 seconds (do not overprocess).

Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead, if necessary, a couple of times to bring it together. Divide the dough in half, and roll each half into a log measuring about 2½ inches in diameter and 3 inches long. Wrap each log with plastic wrap and refrigerate until very firm, at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.

With racks in the upper- and lower-middle positions, preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick baking mats, and set aside.

Unwrap the dough logs and, using a serrated knife, cut into thirty ¼-inch-thick rounds, giving them a quarter turn between each cut to help preserve the cylindrical shape. Arrange them on the prepared baking sheets about ½ inch apart. Place one slice of sausage onto each slice of dough, pressing to help it adhere.

Bake the talyth until lightly browned around the edges and on the bottom, 24 to 28 minutes, swapping and rotating the baking sheets halfway through. Remove the sheets from the oven and, working quickly, use the underside of a dinner fork to gently press the sausage slices again so they adhere to the dough. Let the talyth cool on the baking sheets to room temperature before serving.

## Orc Bacon

**Serves** 4 as a snack

1 pound thick-cut bacon

3 tablespoons light brown sugar

½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1 teaspoon garlic powder

2 tablespoons orange juice

Preheat the oven to 375°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil. Coat a large wire rack with nonstick cooking spray and set it in the foil-lined pan.

Arrange the bacon slices on the rack, laying them tight against each other so the entire pound fits. Roast until they render some of their fat and shrink a bit, about 12 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar, pepper, garlic powder, and orange juice. Lightly brush the slices with about half of this brown sugar mixture and continue roasting until the brown sugar adheres to the bacon and the bacon appears glossy, about 7 minutes. Using tongs, turn over the slices. Lightly brush the slices with the remaining brown sugar mixture and continue roasting until the brown sugar mixture adheres to the bacon and the bacon appears glossy, 5 to 7 minutes more. Transfer the slices to a serving plate and serve warm.

## Arkhan the Cruel's Flame-Roasted Halfling Chili

**Serves** 4 to 6

1½ tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder

1½ tablespoons chili powder

1¼ teaspoons ground cinnamon

1½ teaspoons dried oregano

¾ teaspoon ground cumin

½ teaspoon ground allspice

¼ teaspoon ground cloves

¼ teaspoon cayenne, or as needed

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 (15-ounce) cans red kidney beans, drained and rinsed

2 cups low-sodium chicken broth

4 slices bacon

1 large yellow onion, finely chopped

5 garlic cloves, finely chopped

1 (15-ounce) can tomato puree

2 teaspoons dark or light brown sugar

1 pound lean ground turkey

1 teaspoon cider vinegar

Oyster crackers, freshly cooked buttered noodles, grated Cheddar cheese, and/or finely chopped onion for serving (optional)

The cocoa powder contributes both flavor complexity and a dark hue to the chili, without making it taste of chocolate. The cayenne gives a bare tingle, but you can certainly add more if you like your chili spicy-hot.

In a small bowl, mix together the cocoa powder, chili powder, cinnamon, oregano, cumin, allspice, cloves, cayenne, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper. Set aside.

In a blender or food processor, puree half the kidney beans with about ¾ cup of the broth until smooth and set aside.

In a small Dutch oven over medium heat, fry the bacon, turning it over as necessary, until well-rendered and lightly browned, about 13 minutes. Transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain, chop it, and reserve.

Return the pot to medium heat, add the onion and a pinch of salt to the rendered bacon fat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and the reserved spice mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add the remaining 1¼ cups broth and bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen and dissolve any browned bits. Add the tomato puree, brown sugar, and pureed bean mixture and stir to incorporate. Add the ground turkey and break it into large chunks (it will break down more on its own). Add the remaining kidney beans and stir to mix. Adjust the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer; then adjust the heat to medium-low and simmer to blend flavors and thicken slightly, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Add the vinegar and reserved bacon and stir. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve with oyster crackers or noodles, cheese, and onion, as desired.

## Barovian Butterscotch Pudding

**Serves** 4

¼ cup unsalted butter

⅔ cup packed dark brown sugar

2 tablespoons water

1½ tablespoons light corn syrup

1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

¾ teaspoon kosher salt

¾ cup heavy cream

2 cups whole milk

3 egg yolks

3 tablespoons cornstarch

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

1 tablespoon Scotch or Irish whiskey (see Cook's Note)

Very lightly sweetened whipped cream for serving

Avoid using a heavily peated Scotch, which can overwhelm the dish with smokiness.

In a heavy saucepan over medium heat, combine the butter, brown sugar, water, corn syrup, lemon juice, and salt. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally to melt the butter and dissolve the sugar. Continue cooking at a rolling boil, stirring occasionally, until the mixture registers 240°F on an instant-read or candy thermometer, about 3 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium-low and simmer gently (the mixture should bubble lazily and steadily—if not, adjust the heat accordingly), stirring frequently, until the mixture registers 300° to 310°F on the thermometer and has a bittersweet, borderline burnt fragrance, about 6 minutes more.

Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk together the cream and milk to combine. In another bowl, whisk the yolks, cornstarch, and a little of the cream-milk mixture until uniform; take care to work out any tiny lumps of cornstarch.

Remove the pan with the brown-sugar caramel mixture from the heat. Very carefully pour in about ½ cup of the cream-milk mixture; the mixture will bubble, steam, and possibly splatter. Whisk vigorously, but with care, for about 1 minute, reaching into the corners of the pan. If some of the caramel mixture is seized or still stuck in the corners of the pan, it will re-melt and loosen again. Return the pan to medium heat and, whisking constantly, add the remaining cream-milk mixture; continue whisking until any bits of seized caramel have melted fully and the mixture just reaches a simmer, about 3 minutes.

Whisking constantly, gradually add about ½ cup of the caramel to the egg yolks. Again whisking constantly, add the egg mixture to the pan and continue to cook, whisking constantly, for 1 minute more. Remove from the heat, add the vanilla and Scotch, and whisk to incorporate.

Set a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl. Pour in the pudding and, with a flexible spatula, fold and stir the pudding gently to work it through the strainer. With a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap, cover the pudding, pressing the paper or wrap directly onto the pudding surface.

Refrigerate until cold and set, at least 4 or up to 24 hours. At serving time, stir the pudding gently until smooth, then top with the whipped cream.

## Braised Lamb

**Serves** 4 to 6

1½ tablespoons olive oil

15 garlic cloves, finely chopped

1½ tablespoons finely chopped fresh thyme

1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary

3½ pounds butterflied boneless leg of lamb, untied and netting discarded, if necessary

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 teaspoons neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

½ cup dry vermouth

1½ pounds (about 5 cups) frozen pearl onions, thawed, drained, and blotted dry

2 teaspoons light brown sugar

3 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

¼ cup chopped fresh mint

A boneless leg of lamb can take up to 30 minutes to trim. Because the leg includes muscles of varying thickness, use a sharp boning knife to cut slits in the meat and then pound the whole leg to even the thickness before rolling and tying it.

In a small nonstick skillet over medium heat, mix the olive oil, garlic, thyme, and rosemary and cook, stirring, until it just begins to sizzle, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape the mixture into a small bowl (you should have about ⅓ cup); remove 1½ tablespoons of the mixture and reserve separately.

With a sharp, thin-bladed (boning) knife, trim the fat, gristle, and silverskin from both the exterior and interior of the lamb. With the tip of the knife, make cuts in the larger muscles to help them flatten; cover the meat with plastic wrap and pound it to as even a thickness as possible. With the tip of the knife, lightly score the interior side of the meat with ¼-inch-deep cuts about 1 inch apart in a crosshatch pattern. Rub the greater quantity of the garlic-herb mixture over the scored surface, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges; sprinkle evenly with 1½ teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Roll the meat into a neat, compact cylinder, tucking in any loose bits and flaps as you go, and tie with kitchen twine at 1½-inch intervals, as well as once or twice lengthwise. Set the lamb aside at room temperature to rest for 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 400°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Dry the lamb with paper towels and generously sprinkle it all over with salt and pepper.

In a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil until shimmering. Add the lamb and brown well on all sides, turning it once every 3 minutes, for about 12 minutes. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast until the center of the meat registers 120° to 125°F for medium-rare (or 130° to 135°F for medium to medium-well) on an instant-read thermometer, about 40 minutes.

Transfer the lamb to a carving board, cover loosely with foil, and let rest for about 15 minutes (the internal temperature will increase while the meat rests).

Meanwhile, taking care with the screaming-hot skillet, set it over medium-high heat. Add the vermouth and bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping the bottom of the skillet to loosen and dissolve any sticking bits. Add the pearl onions and ¾ teaspoon salt, return to a simmer, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the brown sugar and reserved garlic-herb mixture, stir to incorporate, and continue simmering, uncovered, until the onions are fully tender and the liquid in the pan is reduced to about 1 tablespoon, about 4 minutes more.

Remove the skillet from the heat, add the butter, and stir to melt and incorporate it. Add the lemon juice and pepper to taste and stir to incorporate. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, if necessary. Add most of the mint and stir to distribute.

Remove the twine, slice the lamb, and arrange on a warmed serving platter. Transfer the mint mixture to the platter with the lamb or into its own serving bowl, sprinkle with the remaining mint, and serve at once.

## Bytopian Shepherd's Bread

**Makes** one 8½-inch loaf

2 cups all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon baking soda

2 teaspoons ground ginger

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

½ teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg

1 teaspoon kosher salt

½ cup currants

3 eggs

¾ cup packed light brown sugar

¼ cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled

⅓ cup buttermilk

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

1 pound carrots, peeled and coarsely grated (about 3 cups)

½ cup slivered or sliced almonds

Preheat the oven to 350°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Lightly oil or butter a 8½ by 4½-inch nonstick loaf pan.

In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt to combine. Add the currants and stir to distribute.

In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and brown sugar until well blended. Add the melted butter and whisk to combine thoroughly. Add the buttermilk and vanilla extract and whisk to combine thoroughly. Stir in the carrots. Add the dry mixture and, using a flexible spatula, fold and stir until the wet and dry ingredients are just incorporated; do not overmix. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Sprinkle the almonds evenly over the batter and press them very lightly to help them adhere.

Bake until the almonds on top are golden, the edges of the loaf pull away from the pan, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 55 minutes, rotating the pan 180 degrees midway through the baking time.

Cool the pan on a wire rack for about 15 minutes. Turn the loaf out, place it right-side up onto the rack, cool to room temperature, and serve.

**Serves** 6

3 tablespoons olive oil

1 pound cremini mushrooms, thinly sliced

Kosher salt

1 large yellow onion, finely chopped

7 garlic cloves, finely chopped

¼ cup dry sherry, such as Amontillado

3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

1¾ cups ricotta, preferably whole-milk ricotta

1 egg

1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Freshly ground black pepper

¼ cup small pieces dried mushrooms, such as porcini or shiitake (optional)

2½ ounces Italian Fontina cheese, shredded (about ¾ cup)

36 square wonton wrappers (from one 12-ounce package)

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the olive oil until shimmering. Add the cremini mushrooms and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushroom liquid evaporates and they just start to sizzle and brown, about 12 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium, clear the center of the pan, add another 1 tablespoon olive oil, and allow it to heat for a moment. Add half of the onion and ¼ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the onion softens, about 4 minutes more; stir the onion into the mushrooms. Add half of the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add the sherry and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan to release and dissolve any browned bits, about 1 minute more. Scrape the ragout mixture into a bowl, add the parsley, and stir to incorporate. Set aside to cool to room temperature.

Wipe out the skillet, add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, return the pan to medium heat, and warm until shimmering. Add the remaining onion and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the remaining garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Scrape the mixture into a medium bowl. Add the ricotta, egg, ½ cup of the Parmesan, ¼ teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of black pepper to the bowl. Stir until uniform, then set aside to cool to room temperature.

If you are using the dried mushrooms, in an electric spice grinder or mini food processor, pulverize the mushroom pieces until very, very fine and powdery. Add the powder to the ricotta mixture and stir until well blended.

In a small bowl, mix together the Fontina and remaining ½ cup Parmesan cheese.

Preheat the oven to 375°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Coat a 12-cup muffin tin (preferably nonstick) with nonstick cooking spray.

To assemble, press one wonton wrapper into each cup, followed by about 1 tablespoon each of the ricotta mixture and mushroom ragout mixture, spreading each into an even layer. Add another wonton wrapper, rotating it slightly so the corners do not line up with the wrapper on the bottom. Repeat the layering with the remaining wonton wrappers and ricotta and mushroom ragout mixtures, always rotating the wonton wrappers, so the corners do not line up. Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of the shredded cheese mixture evenly all the way to the edge of each cup; try to keep the cheese layer as thin as possible.

Bake until the cheese is melted, the edges of the wonton wrappers are browned, and the mini pies are hot all the way through, about 20 minutes, rotating the muffin tin 180 degrees halfway through the baking time.

Rest the mini pies for about 5 minutes. Use a dinner knife or small heatproof spatula to help remove them from the muffin cups (work carefully so they stay intact) and serve.

## Fire-Spiced Abyssal Chicken Kebabs

**Serves** 4

3 tablespoons unsulphured molasses (not blackstrap)

1 tablespoon fresh lime juice

1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce

1½ tablespoons chili powder

2 teaspoons light or dark brown sugar

1 teaspoon smoked paprika

1 teaspoon onion powder

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs (about 8), trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces

3 large poblano peppers, seeded and cut into 1½-inch squares

2 red onions, halved lengthwise and cut into 8 equal chunks

1½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

8 slices thick-cut bacon, each cut crosswise into 3 pieces

⅓ cup chopped fresh mint for garnish

Double-skewering helps prevent the pieces of food from spinning as you move the kebabs on the grill. Consequently, you will need sixteen skewers (wooden or metal) to make the eight kebabs.

If using wooden skewers, soak them in a bowl of water for 20 minutes prior to grilling.

In a bowl, whisk together the molasses, lime juice, and hot pepper sauce. Set aside.

In another bowl, whisk together the chili powder, brown sugar, paprika, onion powder, 2 teaspoons salt, and 2 teaspoons pepper to blend. Add the chicken and toss to coat.

Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill on high for 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, gently toss the poblanos and onions (breaking up the onion chunks into pieces of two or three layers) with the olive oil, a pinch of salt, and a pinch of pepper. Stand two skewers side-by-side, ½ inch apart, with pointed sides facing up. Thread the set of double skewers with alternating pieces of chicken, onion, bacon, and poblano, making sure that the pieces are not too tight against each other; repeat with the remaining chicken, vegetables, and bacon. You should be able to make eight kabobs.

Grill the kebabs, turning every 3 minutes, until the onions and poblanos are tender and grill-marked, and the chicken is well-browned and cooked through, about 15 minutes. Brush the kebabs all over with the molasses mixture and grill for about 1 minute on each side (do not let them burn.) Remove the kebabs from the grill and let rest for about 3 minutes. Garnish with fresh mint and serve hot.

## Fried Fingers

**Serves** 4

#### Plum Sauce

1 tablespoon neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

¼ cup finely chopped scallion whites

Kosher salt

2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger

1 large garlic clove, finely chopped

¼ teaspoon five-spice powder

1 cup plum jam or preserves

1½ tablespoons plain rice vinegar

1 tablespoon soy sauce

1 tablespoon light brown sugar

Freshly ground black pepper

#### Chicken Fingers

ups panko bread crumbs

3 cups packed kettle-cooked potato chips (about 5 ounces), crushed to fine crumbs

2 teaspoons dry mustard powder

2 teaspoons garlic powder

Pinch of cayenne, or to taste

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

½ cup all-purpose flour

2 eggs

4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (6 to 8 ounces each), cut on the lengthwise diagonal into ¾-inch-wide strips

Olive oil cooking spray

A good method for crushing the potato chips is to put them in a resealable bag and roll over it repeatedly with a rolling pin until the chips are finely crushed.

***Make the Sauce.*** In a small saucepan over medium heat, warm the oil until shimmering. Add the scallion whites and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the ginger, garlic, and five-spice powder and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the jam, vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, and pepper to taste and whisk to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring, 3 to 5 minutes. Adjust the heat to low and continue simmering and stirring to blend the flavors, about 1 minute. Scrape the sauce into a microwave-safe container and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 325°F with a rack in the upper-middle of the oven. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil.

***Make the Chicken Fingers.*** Spread the panko in an even layer on the foil-lined baking sheet and bake until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring several times. Scrape the toasted panko into a wide, shallow dish, add the crushed potato chips, mustard powder, garlic powder, cayenne, 1¼ teaspoons salt, and a few grinds of pepper. Stir to distribute the potato chips and seasonings. In a second wide, shallow dish, spread the flour. In a third wide shallow dish, whisk the eggs, a pinch of salt, and a few grinds of pepper until well blended.

Adjust the oven temperature to 500°F and fit a wire rack into the foil-lined baking sheet.

Blot dry the chicken strips and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Working with several pieces of chicken at a time, dredge them in the flour and tap off any excess. Dip the floured chicken pieces into the egg mixture to coat thoroughly, allow any excess egg to drip off. Then dredge them in the panko mixture to coat thoroughly, pressing it onto the chicken to help it adhere. Carefully transfer the chicken pieces to the rack on the baking sheet (they should not overlap) and coat them with cooking spray.

Bake until the coating is deep golden brown and crisp and the chicken fingers are cooked through (they will feel firm when squeezed gently with your fingertips), 10 to 12 minutes, checking them frequently, turning them over and coating the second side midway through the cooking time and rotating the pan 180 degrees for even cooking. Cool the chicken fingers for about 4 minutes.

If the sauce has cooled completely and you want to serve it warm, cover the dish, and microwave briefly to reheat. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve the fried fingers hot, passing the sauce on the side.

## Hardbuckler Stew

**Serves** 6

2 tablespoons neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

1½ pounds cremini mushrooms, quartered

Kosher salt

2½ pounds boneless lamb shoulder roast, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1-inch chunks

Freshly ground black pepper

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1 large yellow onion, chopped

1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme, or 1½ teaspoons dried

3 bay leaves

2 cups low-sodium chicken broth

1 pound turnip or rutabaga, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces (about 4 cups)

1½ pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces

1 teaspoon sherry vinegar

½ cup chopped fresh parsley

In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil until shimmering. Add the mushrooms and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms release their liquid and it evaporates, about 15 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium and continue cooking, stirring often, until the mushrooms brown, about 5 minutes more. Scrape the mushrooms into a bowl and set aside.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 325°F with a rack in the lower-middle of the oven.

In a bowl, toss the lamb with 1½ teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and the flour to coat. In the now-empty Dutch oven, warm the remaining 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add half the lamb so that the pieces are close together in a single layer but not touching (do not crowd pan) and cook, undisturbed, until deeply browned on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the pieces over and cook, undisturbed, until second side is deeply browned, 3 to 4 minutes more; transfer the lamb to a bowl. Repeat to brown the remaining lamb (adjusting the heat as necessary to avoid scorching); transfer to the bowl with the first batch.

Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from the pot. Return the pot to medium heat, add the onion, thyme, bay leaves, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned bits, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the broth, adjust the heat to medium-high, and scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen and dissolve any remaining browned bits. Add the cooked lamb with its accumulated juices, stir to combine, cover, and bake for 40 minutes. Add the turnip pieces, submerge them in the liquid as best you can, replace the cover, and continue to bake for 30 minutes more. Add the potatoes and mushrooms, submerge them in the liquid as best you can, replace the cover, and continue to bake until the lamb and all the vegetables are very tender, about 1¼ hours more. If the stew is more liquidy than you'd like, mash some of the potatoes against the side of the pot to help thicken it.

Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Remove the bay leaves, add the vinegar and most of the parsley, and stir to combine. Serve, sprinkling each serving with some of the remaining parsley.

## Surrogate Steaks

**Serves** 4

1½ pounds plant-based ground meat, such as Impossible Burger

1 tablespoon soy sauce

2 teaspoons garlic powder

1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme

Kosher salt

2½ tablespoons freshly and very coarsely ground black pepper

1 tablespoon neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

1 shallot, finely chopped

2 garlic cloves, finely chopped

½ cup brandy or cognac, plus 1 tablespoon

1 cup low-sodium vegetable broth

⅓ cup heavy cream

½ teaspoon light brown sugar

2 teaspoons grainy mustard (optional)

½ teaspoon fresh lemon juice

1½ tablespoons snipped fresh chives

Preheat the oven to 200°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.

In a large bowl, break up the meat into coarse chunks. Add the soy sauce, garlic powder, 1½ teaspoons of the thyme, and ¾ teaspoon salt. Mix to distribute the seasonings fully, but do not overmix. Shape the mixture into two "steaks," about 5 inches in diameter and 1¼ inches thick.

Spread the pepper in a wide, shallow dish, such as a pie plate. Dredge one side of each steak in the pepper, pressing lightly to make it adhere.

In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, warm 1½ teaspoons of the oil until shimmering. Add the steaks, unpeppered-side down, and cook undisturbed until well-browned on the bottom, about 4 minutes; if the skillet becomes too smoky at any point, adjust the heat accordingly. Adjust the heat to medium, turn the steaks peppered-side down, and cook undisturbed for 2 minutes more. Transfer the steaks to an ovenproof plate, tent loosely with foil, and place it in the oven to stay warm. Pour off any fat accumulated in the skillet and wipe it out.

Add the remaining 1½ teaspoons oil to the skillet over medium heat, and warm until shimmering. Add the shallot, remaining 1½ teaspoons thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, until the shallot is barely softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add the ½ cup brandy and cook until reduced slightly, about 1 minute more. Add the broth, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced by almost half, about 5 minutes. Add the cream and sugar and cook, stirring, until the liquid is reduced slightly and coats the back of a spoon, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat; add the mustard (if using), 1 tablespoon brandy, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon of the chives; and stir to incorporate. Taste and adjust with salt, if necessary. Spoon the sauce over and around the steaks and sprinkle with the remaining chives. Serve at once.

## Twice-Baked Cockatrice Wings

**Serves** 4

3½ pounds chicken wings, halved at the joints, wing tips removed

1 tablespoon baking powder

1½ teaspoons salt

1½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper

2½ tablespoons garam masala powder

The initial roasting at the lower oven temperature allows the fat to render, which aids in crisping the skin, as does the baking powder.

Preheat the oven to 300°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Set a wire rack in a large rimmed baking sheet.

In a large bowl, toss the chicken wings with the baking powder to coat. Add the salt and pepper and toss again to coat. Arrange the wings skin-side up on the wire rack and roast for 40 minutes. Adjust the heat to 425°F and continue to roast until the wings are golden brown and crisp, about 40 minutes more. Sprinkle the wings with the garam masala and continue to roast for 10 minutes more. Using tongs, carefully remove the wings from the rack. Serve hot.
