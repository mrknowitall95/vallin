## Charlatan

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Sleight of Hand
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Disguise kit*, *Forgery kit*
- **Equipment:** A set of *fine clothes*, a *disguise kit*, tools of the con of your choice (ten stoppered bottles filled with colored liquid, a set of weighted dice, a deck of marked cards, or a signet ring of an imaginary duke), and a belt *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: False Identity

Additionally, you can forge documents including official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy.

|  d6 | Scam                                                                                        |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I cheat at games of chance.                                                                 |
|  2  | I shave coins or forge documents.                                                           |
|  3  | I insinuate myself into people's lives to prey on their weakness and secure their fortunes. |
|  4  | I put on new identities like clothes.                                                       |
|  5  | I run sleight-of-hand cons on street corners.                                               |
|  6  | I convince people that worthless junk is worth their hard-earned money.                     |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Charlatans are colorful characters who conceal their true selves behind the masks they construct. They reflect what people want to see, what they want to believe, and how they see the world. But their true selves are sometimes plagued by an uneasy conscience, an old enemy, or deep-seated trust issues.

|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I fall in and out of love easily, and am always pursuing someone.                                      |
|  2  | I have a joke for every occasion, especially occasions where humor is inappropriate.                   |
|  3  | Flattery is my preferred trick for getting what I want.                                                |
|  4  | I'm a born gambler who can't resist taking a risk for a potential payoff.                              |
|  5  | I lie about almost everything, even when there's no reason to.                                         |
|  6  | Sarcasm and insults are my weapons of choice.                                                          |
|  7  | I keep multiple holy symbols on me and invoke whatever deity might come in useful at any given moment. |
|  8  | I pocket anything I see that might have some value.                                                    |

|  d6 | Ideal                                                                              |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Independence. I am a free spirit—no one tells me what to do. (Chaotic)             |
|  2  | Fairness. I never target people who can't afford to lose a few coins. (Lawful)     |
|  3  | Charity. I distribute the money I acquire to the people who really need it. (Good) |
|  4  | Creativity. I never run the same con twice. (Chaotic)                              |
|  5  | Friendship. Material goods come and go. Bonds of friendship last forever. (Good)   |
|  6  | Aspiration. I'm determined to make something of myself. (Any)                      |

|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I fleeced the wrong person and must work to ensure that this individual never crosses paths with me or those I care about.       |
|  2  | I owe everything to my mentor—a horrible person who's probably rotting in jail somewhere.                                        |
|  3  | Somewhere out there, I have a child who doesn't know me. I'm making the world better for him or her.                             |
|  4  | I come from a noble family, and one day I'll reclaim my lands and title from those who stole them from me.                       |
|  5  | A powerful person killed someone I love. Some day soon, I'll have my revenge.                                                    |
|  6  | I swindled and ruined a person who didn't deserve it. I seek to atone for my misdeeds but might never be able to forgive myself. |

|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                                           |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I can't resist a pretty face.                                                                                  |
|  2  | I'm always in debt. I spend my ill-gotten gains on decadent luxuries faster than I bring them in.              |
|  3  | I'm convinced that no one could ever fool me the way I fool others.                                            |
|  4  | I'm too greedy for my own good. I can't resist taking a risk if there's money involved.                        |
|  5  | I can't resist swindling people who are more powerful than me.                                                 |
|  6  | I hate to admit it and will hate myself for it, but I'll run and preserve my own hide if the going gets tough. |

#### Specialty

There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves' guild or similar criminal organization, individual members have particular specialties. Even criminals who operate outside of such organizations have strong preferences for certain kinds of crimes over others. Choose the role you played in your criminal life, or roll on the table below.

|  d8 | Specialty      |
|:---:|----------------|
|  1  | Blackmailer    |
|  2  | Burglar        |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                                      |

|  2  | I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me.                  |
|  3  | The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable—or where such things could be hidden. |
|  4  | I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy.                                                                     |
|  5  | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.                                 |
|  6  | I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.                                             |
|  7  | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it.                                                    |
|  8  | I blow up at the slightest insult.                                                                                     |

|  2  | Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic)                                          |
|  3  | Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good)                                                   |

|  5  | People. I'm loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care. (Neutral) |
|  6  | Redemption. There's a spark of good in everyone. (Good)                                                                       |

|  3  | Something important was taken from me, and I aim to steal it back.              |
|  4  | I will become the greatest thief that ever lived.                               |
|  5  | I'm guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it.              |

|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it.   |
|  2  | When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money. |
|  3  | If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it.           |
|  4  | I have a 'tell' that reveals when I'm lying.                                       |
|  5  | I turn tail and run when things look bad.                                          |
|  6  | An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that.  |

- **Equipment:** A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a *shovel*, an *iron pot*, a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.

#### Specialty

You previously pursued a simple profession among the peasantry, perhaps as a farmer, miner, servant, shepherd, woodcutter, or gravedigger. But something happened that set you on a different path and marked you for greater things. Choose or randomly determine a defining event that marked you as a hero of the people.

| d10 | Defining Event                                                                            |

|  2  | I saved people during a natural disaster.                                                 |

|  4  | I stole from a corrupt merchant to help the poor.                                         |
|  5  | I led a militia to fight off an invading army.                                            |
|  6  | I broke into a tyrant's castle and stole weapons to arm the people.                       |
|  7  | I trained the peasantry to use farming implements as weapons against a tyrant's soldiers. |
|  8  | A lord rescinded an unpopular decree after I led a symbolic act of protest against it.    |
|  9  | A celestial, fey, or similar creature gave me a blessing or revealed my secret origin.    |
|  10 | Recruited into a lord's army, I rose to leadership and was commended for my heroism.      |

#### Suggested Characteristics

A folk hero is one of the common people, for better or for worse. Most folk heroes look on their humble origins as a virtue, not a shortcoming, and their home communities remain very important to them.

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                   |

|  7  | I misuse long words in an attempt to sound smarter.                                                 |

|  3  | Freedom. Tyrants must not be allowed to oppress the people. (Chaotic)                                    |
|  4  | Might. If I become strong, I can take what I want—what I deserve. (Evil)                                 |

|  5  | I protect those who cannot protect themselves.                                                      |

## Guild Artisan

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a letter of introduction from your guild, a set of *traveler's clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Guild Membership

As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.

Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.

You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.

#### Specialty

Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to support several artisans practicing the same trade. However, your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.

|  20 | Woodcarvers, coopers, and bowyers          |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world—until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career. They understand the value of hard work and the importance of community, but they're vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.

|  1  | I believe that anything worth doing is worth doing right. I can't help it—I'm a perfectionist.                                       |
|  2  | I'm a snob who looks down on those who can't appreciate fine art.                                                                    |

## Guild Merchant (Guild Artisan)

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools, or *navigator's tools*, or an additional language
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice) or a *mule* and *cart*, a letter of introduction from your guild, a set of *traveler's clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Guild Membership

As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings.

Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.

You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.

#### Specialty

Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to support several artisans practicing the same trade. However, your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the world—until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career. They understand the value of hard work and the importance of community, but they're vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.

## Hermit

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Medicine, Religion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Herbalism kit*
- **Languages:** One of your choice
- **Equipment:** A *scroll case* stuffed full of notes from your studies or prayers, a winter *blanket*, a set of *common clothes*, an *herbalism kit*, and 5 gp

#### Feature: Discovery

The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.

Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.

#### Specialty

What was the reason for your isolation, and what changed to allow you to end your solitude? You can work with your DM to determine the exact nature of your seclusion, or you can choose or roll on the table below to determine the reason behind your seclusion.

|  d8 | Life of Seclusion                                                                        |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I was searching for spiritual enlightenment.                                             |
|  2  | I was partaking of communal living in accordance with the dictates of a religious order. |
|  3  | I was exiled for a crime I didn't commit.                                                |
|  4  | I retreated from society after a life-altering event.                                    |
|  5  | I needed a quiet place to work on my art, literature, music, or manifesto.               |
|  6  | I needed to commune with nature, far from civilization.                                  |
|  7  | I was the caretaker of an ancient ruin or relic.                                         |
|  8  | I was a pilgrim in search of a person, place, or relic of spiritual significance.        |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Some hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion, whereas others chafe against it and long for company. Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it, the solitary life shapes their attitudes and ideals. A few are driven slightly mad by their years apart from society.

|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I've been isolated for so long that I rarely speak, preferring gestures and the occasional grunt.         |
|  2  | I am utterly serene, even in the face of disaster.                                                        |
|  3  | The leader of my community had something wise to say on every topic, and I am eager to share that wisdom. |
|  4  | I feel tremendous empathy for all who suffer.                                                             |
|  5  | I'm oblivious to etiquette and social expectations.                                                       |
|  6  | I connect everything that happens to me to a grand, cosmic plan.                                          |
|  7  | I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, becoming oblivious to my surroundings.             |
|  8  | I am working on a grand philosophical theory and love sharing my ideas.                                   |

|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Greater Good. My gifts are meant to be shared with all, not used for my own benefit. (Good)           |
|  2  | Logic. Emotions must not cloud our sense of what is right and true, or our logical thinking. (Lawful) |
|  3  | Free Thinking. Inquiry and curiosity are the pillars of progress. (Chaotic)                           |
|  4  | Power. Solitude and contemplation are paths toward mystical or magical power. (Evil)                  |
|  5  | Live and Let Live. Meddling in the affairs of others only causes trouble. (Neutral)                   |
|  6  | Self-Knowledge. If you know yourself, there's nothing left to know. (Any)                             |

|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Nothing is more important than the other members of my hermitage, order, or association.               |
|  2  | I entered seclusion to hide from the ones who might still be hunting me. I must someday confront them. |
|  3  | I'm still seeking the enlightenment I pursued in my seclusion, and it still eludes me.                 |
|  4  | I entered seclusion because I loved someone I could not have.                                          |

#### Feature: Position of Privilege

Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.

- **Equipment:** A set of *fine clothes*, a *signet ring*, a scroll of pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp

#### Variant Noble (Knight)

A knighthood is among the lowest noble titles in most societies, but it can be a path to higher status. If you wish to be a knight, choose the Retainers feature instead of the Position of Privilege feature.

As an emblem of chivalry and the ideals of courtly love, you might include among your equipment a banner or other token from a noble lord or lady to whom you have given your heart-in a chaste sort of devotion.

#### Feature: Retainers

You have the service of three retainers loyal to your family. These retainers can be attendants or messengers, and one might be a majordomo. **One of your retainers is a noble who serves as your squire, aiding you in exchange for training on his or her own path to knighthood** (This person could be your bond.). Your two remaining retainers might include a groom to care for your horse and a servant who polishes your armor (and even helps you put it on).

Your retainers can perform mundane tasks for you, but they do not fight for you, will not follow you into obviously dangerous areas (such as dungeons), and will leave if they are frequently endangered or abused.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle than most people ever experience, and their personalities reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a plethora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles (including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the family's care, or even to the title itself. But this responsibility is often a good way to undermine a noble.

Often considered rude and uncouth among civilized folk, outlanders have little respect for the niceties of life in the cities. The ties of tribe, clan, family, and the natural world of which they are a part are the most important bonds to most outlanders.

|  4  | I have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature.                                                          |
|  5  | I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won't save you from a hungry owlbear.                 |
|  6  | I'm always picking things up, absently fiddling with them, and sometimes accidentally breaking them.                       |
|  7  | I feel far more comfortable around animals than people.                                                                    |
|  8  | I was, in fact, raised by wolves.                                                                                          |

|  1  | My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me. |

|  4  | I am the last of my tribe, and it is up to me to ensure their names enter legend.                 |
|  5  | I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it.                   |

|  3  | I remember every insult I've received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who's ever wronged me.                |
|  4  | I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies.                                                       |

## Sage

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, History
- **Languages:** Two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A *bottle of black ink*, a quill, a small knife, a letter from a dead colleague posing a question you have not yet been able to answer, a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Researcher

When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

#### Specialty

To determine the nature of your scholarly training, roll a d8 or choose from the options in the table below.

|  d8 | Field of Study       |
|:---:|----------------------|
|  1  | Alchemist            |
|  2  | Astronomer           |
|  3  | Discredited academic |
|  4  | Librarian            |
|  5  | Professor            |
|  6  | Researcher           |
|  7  | Wizard's apprentice  |
|  8  | Scribe               |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Sages are defined by their extensive studies, and their characteristics reflect this life of study. Devoted to scholarly pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly—sometimes in its own right, sometimes as a means toward other ideals.

|  3  | I'm used to helping out those who aren't as smart as I am, and I patiently explain anything and everything to others. |
|  4  | There's nothing I like more than a good mystery.                                                                      |

|  2  | Beauty. What is beautiful points us beyond itself toward what is true. (Good)                  |

|  4  | No Limits. Nothing should fetter the infinite possibility inherent in all existence. (Chaotic) |

|  6  | Self-Improvement. The goal of a life of study is the betterment of oneself. (Any)              |

|  3  | Unlocking an ancient mystery is worth the price of a civilization.                      |
|  4  | I overlook obvious solutions in favor of complicated ones.                              |
|  5  | I speak without really thinking through my words, invariably insulting others.          |

## Sailor

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Perception
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Navigator's tools*, vehicles (water)
- **Equipment:** A belaying pin (*club*), *silk rope (50 feet)*, a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a random *trinket* on the Trinkets table in chapter 5), a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Ship's Passage

When you need to, you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                           |

|  3  | I enjoy sailing into new ports and making new friends over a flagon of ale. |
|  4  | I stretch the truth for the sake of a good story.                           |
|  5  | To me, a tavern brawl is a nice way to get to know a new city.              |
|  6  | I never pass up a friendly wager.                                           |

|  2  | Fairness. We all do the work, so we all share in the rewards. (Lawful)                           |
|  3  | Freedom. The sea is freedom—the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. (Chaotic)                |
|  4  | Mastery. I'm a predator, and the other ships on the sea are my prey. (Evil)                      |
|  5  | People. I'm committed to my crewmates, not to ideals. (Neutral)                                  |
|  6  | Aspiration. Someday, I'll own my own ship and chart my own destiny. (Any)                        |

|  2  | The ship is most important—crewmates and captains come and go.                                                      |
|  3  | I'll always remember my first ship.                                                                                 |
|  4  | In a harbor town, I have a paramour whose eyes nearly stole me from the sea.                                        |
|  5  | I was cheated out of my fair share of the profits, and I want to get my due.                                        |
|  6  | Ruthless pirates murdered my captain and crewmates, plundered our ship, and left me to die. Vengeance will be mine. |

|  3  | Once someone questions my courage, I never back down no matter how dangerous the situation. |
|  4  | Once I start drinking, it's hard for me to stop.                                            |
|  5  | I can't help but pocket loose coins and other trinkets I come across.                       |

## Pirate (Sailor)

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Perception
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Navigator's tools*, vehicles (water)
- **Equipment:** A belaying pin (*club*), *silk rope (50 feet)*, a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a random *trinket* on the Trinkets table in chapter 5), a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Bad Reputation

No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your reputation. When you are in a civilized settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.

|  4  | Once I start drinking, it's hard for me to stop.                                            |
|  5  | I can't help but pocket loose coins and other trinkets I come across.                       |
|  6  | My pride will probably lead to my destruction.                                              |

## Soldier

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Intimidation
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set, vehicles (land)
- **Equipment:** An insignia of rank, a trophy taken from a fallen enemy (a *dagger*, broken blade, or piece of a banner), a bone *dice set* or *playing card set*, a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Military Rank

You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also usually gain access to friendly military encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.

#### Specialty

During your time as a soldier, you had a specific role to play in your unit or army. Roll a d8 or choose from the options in the table below to determine your role:

|  d8 | Role                                          |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Officer                                       |

|  3  | Infantry                                      |
|  4  | Cavalry                                       |
|  5  | Healer                                        |
|  6  | Quartermaster                                 |
|  7  | Standard-bearer                               |
|  8  | Support staff (cook, blacksmith, or the like) |

#### Suggested Characteristics

The horrors of war combined with the rigid discipline of military service leave their mark on all soldiers, shaping their ideals, creating strong bonds, and often leaving them scarred and vulnerable to fear, shame, and hatred.

|  d8 | Personality Trait                                                                                                 |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I'm always polite and respectful.                                                                                 |
|  2  | I'm haunted by memories of war. I can't get the images of violence out of my mind.                                |
|  3  | I've lost too many friends, and I'm slow to make new ones.                                                        |
|  4  | I'm full of inspiring and cautionary tales from my military experience relevant to almost every combat situation. |
|  5  | I can stare down a hell hound without flinching.                                                                  |
|  6  | I enjoy being strong and like breaking things.                                                                    |
|  7  | I have a crude sense of humor.                                                                                    |

|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Greater Good. Our lot is to lay down our lives in defense of others. (Good)                |
|  2  | Responsibility. I do what I must and obey just authority. (Lawful)                         |
|  3  | Independence. When people follow orders blindly, they embrace a kind of tyranny. (Chaotic) |

|:---:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I would still lay down my life for the people I served with.                               |
|  2  | Someone saved my life on the battlefield. To this day, I will never leave a friend behind. |
|  3  | My honor is my life.                                                                       |
|  4  | I'll never forget the crushing defeat my company suffered or the enemies who dealt it.     |
|  5  | Those who fight beside me are those worth dying for.                                       |
|  6  | I fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.                                         |

|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                                          |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | The monstrous enemy we faced in battle still leaves me quivering with fear.                                   |
|  2  | I have little respect for anyone who is not a proven warrior.                                                 |
|  3  | I made a terrible mistake in battle that cost many lives—and I would do anything to keep that mistake secret. |
|  4  | My hatred of my enemies is blinding and unreasoning.                                                          |
|  5  | I obey the law, even if the law causes misery.                                                                |
|  6  | I'd rather eat my armor than admit when I'm wrong.                                                            |

## Urchin

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Sleight of Hand, Stealth
- **Tool Proficiencies:** *Disguise kit*, *Thieves' tools*
- **Equipment:** A small knife, a map of the city you grew up in, a pet mouse, a token to remember your parents by, a set of *common clothes*, and a belt *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: City Secrets

You know the secret patterns and flow to cities and can find passages through the urban sprawl that others would miss. When you are not in combat, you (and companions you lead) can travel between any two locations in the city twice as fast as your speed would normally allow.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Urchins are shaped by lives of desperate poverty, for good and for ill. They tend to be driven either by a commitment to the people with whom they shared life on the street or by a burning desire to find a better life—and maybe get some payback on all the rich people who treated them badly.

|  2  | I ask a lot of questions.                                                                     |
|  3  | I like to squeeze into small places where no one else can get to me.                          |
|  4  | I sleep with my back to a wall or tree, with everything I own wrapped in a bundle in my arms. |
|  5  | I eat like a pig and have bad manners.                                                        |
|  6  | I think anyone who's nice to me is hiding evil intent.                                        |
|  7  | I don't like to bathe.                                                                        |
|  8  | I bluntly say what others are hinting at or hiding.                                           |

|  2  | Community. We have to take care of each other, because no one else is going to do it. (Lawful)                     |
|  3  | Change. The low are lifted up, and the high and mighty are brought down. Change is the nature of things. (Chaotic) |
|  4  | Retribution. The rich need to be shown what life and death are like in the gutters. (Evil)                         |

|  1  | My town or city is my home, and I'll fight to defend it.                            |
|  2  | I sponsor an orphanage to keep others from enduring what I was forced to endure.    |
|  3  | I owe my survival to another urchin who taught me to live on the streets.           |
|  4  | I owe a debt I can never repay to the person who took pity on me.                   |
|  5  | I escaped my life of poverty by robbing an important person, and I'm wanted for it. |
|  6  | No one else should have to endure the hardships I've been through.                  |

## City Watch

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Insight
- **Languages:** Any two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A uniform in the style of your unit and indicative of your rank, a *horn* with which to summon help, a set of *manacles*, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Watcher's Eye

Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of the city watch.

Your bond is likely associated with your fellow watch members or the watch organization itself and almost certainly concerns your community. Your ideal probably involves the fostering of peace and safety. An investigator is likely to have an ideal connected to achieving justice by successfully solving crimes.

## Clan Crafter

- **Skill Proficiencies:** History, Insight
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of artisan's tools
- **Languages:** Dwarvish or one of your choice if you already speak Dwarvish
- **Equipment:** A set of artisan's tools with which you are proficient, a maker's mark chisel used to mark your handiwork with the symbol of the clan of crafters you learned your skill from, a set of *traveler's clothes*, and a *pouch* containing 5 gp and a gem worth 10 gp

#### Feature: Respect of the Stout Folk

As well respected as clan crafters are among outsiders, no one esteems them quite so highly as dwarves do. You always have free room and board in any place where shield dwarves or gold dwarves dwell, and the individuals in such a settlement might vie among themselves to determine who can offer you (and possibly your companions) the finest accommodations and assistance.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the guild artisan background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a clan crafter. (For instance, consider the words "guild" and "clan" to be interchangeable.)

Your bond is almost certainly related to the master or the clan that taught you, or else to the work that you produce. Your ideal might have to do with maintaining the high quality of your work or preserving the dwarven traditions of craftsmanship.

---

## Cloistered Scholar

- **Skill Proficiencies:** History, plus your choice of one from among Arcana, Nature, and Religion
- **Languages:** any two of your choice
- **Equipment:** The scholar's *robes* of your cloister, a writing kit (small *pouch* with a quill, ink, folded parchment, and a small penknife), a borrowed *book* on the subject of your current study, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Library Access

Though others must often endure extensive interviews and significant fees to gain access to even the most common archives in your library, you have free and easy access to the majority of the library, though it might also have repositories of lore that are too valuable, magical, or secret to permit anyone immediate access.

You have a working knowledge of your cloister's personnel and bureaucracy, and you know how to navigate those connections with some ease.

Additionally, you are likely to gain preferential treatment at other libraries across the Realms, as professional courtesy to a fellow scholar.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the sage background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a cloistered scholar.

Your bond is almost certainly associated either with the place where you grew up or with the knowledge you hope to acquire through adventuring. Your ideal is no doubt related to how you view the quest for knowledge and truth - perhaps as a worthy goal in itself, or maybe as a means to a desirable end.

---

## Courtier

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Persuasion
- **Languages:** Any two of your choice
- **Equipment:** A set of *fine clothes* and a *pouch* containing 5 gp

#### Feature: Court Functionary

Your knowledge of how bureaucracies function lets you gain access to the records and inner workings of any noble court or government you encounter. You know who the movers and shakers are, whom to go to for the favors you seek, and what the current intrigues of interest in the group are.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the guild artisan background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a courtier.

The noble court or bureaucratic organization where you got your start is directly or indirectly associated with your bond (which could pertain to certain individuals in the group, such as your sponsor or mentor). Your ideal might be concerned with the prevailing philosophy of your court or organization.

---

#### Feature: Safe Haven

As a faction agent, you have access to a secret network of supporters and operatives who can provide assistance on your adventures. You know a set of secret signs and passwords you can use to identify such operatives, who can provide you with access to a hidden safe house, free room and board, or assistance in finding information. These agents never risk their lives for you or risk revealing their true identities.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the acolyte background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a faction agent. (For instance, consider the words "faith" and "faction" to be interchangeable.)

Your bond might be associated with other members of your faction, or a location or an object that is important to your faction. The ideal you strive for is probably in keeping with the tenets and principles of your faction, but might be more personal in nature.

## Far Traveler

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Perception
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Any one musical instrument or gaming set of your choice, likely something native to your homeland
- **Languages:** Any one of your choice
- **Equipment:** One set of *traveler's clothes*, any one musical instrument or gaming set you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps from your homeland that depict where you are in Faerûn, a small piece of jewelry worth 10 gp in the style of your homeland's craftsmanship, and a *pouch* containing 5 gp

#### Feature: All Eyes on You

Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.

You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.

#### Why Are You Here?

A far traveler might have set out on a journey for one of a number of reasons, and the departure from his or her homeland could have been voluntary or involuntary. To determine why you are so far from home, roll on the table below or choose from the options provided. The following section, discussing possible homelands, includes some suggested reasons that are appropriate for each location.

|  1  | I have different assumptions from those around me concerning personal space, blithely invading others' space in innocence, or reacting to ignorant invasion of my own. |
|  2  | I have my own ideas about what is and is not food, and I find the eating habits of those around me fascinating, confusing, or revolting.                               |
|  3  | I have a strong code of honor or sense of propriety that others don't comprehend.                                                                                      |

|  6  | I begin or end my day with small traditional rituals that are unfamiliar to those around me.                                                                           |

|  2  | Reserved. As someone new to these strange lands, I am cautious and respectful in my dealings. (Lawful)     |
|  3  | Adventure. I'm far from home, and everything is strange and wonderful! (Chaotic)                           |
|  4  | Cunning. Though I may not know their ways, neither do they know mine, which can be to my advantage. (Evil) |
|  5  | Inquisitive. Everything is new, but I have a thirst to learn. (Neutral)                                    |
|  6  | Suspicious. I must be careful, for I have no way of telling friend from foe here. (Any)                    |

|  d6 | Bond                                                                                                       |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | So long as I have this token from my homeland, I can face any adversity in this strange land.              |
|  2  | The gods of my people are a comfort to me so far away from home.                                           |
|  3  | I hold no greater cause than my service to my people.                                                      |
|  4  | My freedom is my most precious possession. I'll never let anyone take it from me again.                    |
|  5  | I'm fascinated by the beauty and wonder of this new land.                                                  |
|  6  | Though I had no choice, I lament having to leave my loved one(s) behind. I hope to see them again one day. |

|  d6 | Flaw                                                                                                                              |

|  1  | I am secretly (or not so secretly) convinced of the superiority of my own culture over that of this foreign land.                 |
|  2  | I pretend not to understand the local language in order to avoid interactions I would rather not have.                            |
|  3  | I have a weakness for the new intoxicants and other pleasures of this land.                                                       |
|  4  | I don't take kindly to some of the actions and motivations of the people of this land, because these folks are different from me. |
|  5  | I consider the adherents of other gods to be deluded innocents at best, or ignorant fools at worst.                               |
|  6  | I have a weakness for the exotic beauty of the people of these lands.                                                             |

## Inheritor

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Survival, plus one from among Arcana, History, and Religion
- **Languages:** Any one of your choice
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Your choice of a gaming set or a musical instrument
- **Equipment:** Your inheritance, a set of *traveler's clothes*, the tool you choose for this background's tool proficiency (gaming set or musical instrument), and a *pouch* containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Inheritance

Choose or randomly determine your inheritance from the possibilities in the table below. Work with your Dungeon Master to come up with details: Why is your inheritance so important, and what is its full story? You might prefer for the DM to invent these details as part of the game, allowing you to learn more about your inheritance as your character does.

The Dungeon Master is free to use your inheritance as a story hook, sending you on quests to learn more about its history or true nature, or confronting you with foes who want to claim it for themselves or prevent you from learning what you seek. The DM also determines the properties of your inheritance and how they figure into the item's history and importance. For instance, the object might be a minor magic item, or one that begins with a modest ability and increases in potency with the passage of time. Or, the true nature of your inheritance might not be apparent at first and is revealed only when certain conditions are met.

When you begin your adventuring career, you can decide whether to tell your companions about your inheritance right away. Rather than attracting attention to yourself, you might want to keep your inheritance a secret until you learn more about what it means to you and what it can do for you.

|  d8 | Object or item:                                                  |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A document such as a map, a letter, or a journal                 |
| 2-3 | a trinket (see "Trinkets" in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook) |
|  4  | an article of clothing                                           |
|  5  | a piece of jewelry                                               |
|  6  | an arcane book or formulary                                      |
|  7  | a written story, song, poem, or secret                           |
|  8  | a tattoo or other body marking                                   |

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the folk hero background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as an inheritor.

Your bond might be directly related to your inheritance, or to the person from whom you received it. Your ideal might be influenced by what you know about your inheritance, or by what you intend to do with your gift once you realize what it is capable of.

---

## Knight of the Order

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Persuasion, plus one from among Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion, as appropriate for your order
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Your choice of a gaming set or a musical instrument
- **Languages:** Any one of your choice
- **Equipment:** One set of *traveler's clothes*, a signet, banner, or seal representing your place or rank in the order, and a *pouch* containing 10 gp

#### Feature: Knightly Regard

You receive shelter and succor from members of your knightly order and those who are sympathetic to its aims. If your order is a religious one, you can gain aid from temples and other religious communities of your deity. Knights of civic orders can get help from the community—whether a lone settlement or a great nation—that they serve, and knights of philosophical orders can find help from those they have aided in pursuit of their ideals, and those who share their ideals.

This help comes in the form of shelter and meals, and healing when appropriate, as well as occasionally risky assistance, such as a band of local citizens rallying to aid a sorely pressed knight, or those who support the order helping to smuggle a knight out of town when he or she is being hunted unjustly.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a knight of your order.

Your bond almost always involves the order to which you belong (or at least key members of it), and it is highly unusual for a knight's ideal not to reflect the agenda, sentiment, or philosophy of one's order.

---

## Mercenary Veteran

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Persuasion
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of gaming set, vehicles (land)
- **Equipment:** A uniform of your company (*traveler's clothes* in quality), an insignia of your rank, a gaming set of your choice, and a *pouch* containing the remainder of your last wages (10 gp).

#### Feature: Mercenary Life

You know the mercenary life as only someone who has experienced it can. You are able to identify mercenary companies by their emblems, and you know a little about any such company, including who has hired them recently. You can find the taverns and festhalls where mercenaries abide in any area, as long as you speak the language. You can find mercenary work between adventures sufficient to maintain a comfortable lifestyle (see "*Practicing a Profession*" under "Downtime Activities" in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook).

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the soldier background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a mercenary.

Your bond could be associated with the company you traveled with previously, or with some of the comrades you served with. The ideal you embrace largely depends on your worldview and your motivation for fighting.

---

## Urban Bounty Hunter

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Choose two from among Deception, Insight, Persuasion, and Stealth
- **Tool Proficiencies:** Choose two from among one type of gaming set, one musical instrument, and *thieves' tools*
- **Equipment:** A set of clothes appropriate to your duties and a *pouch* containing 20 gp

#### Feature: Ear to the Ground

You are in frequent contact with people in the segment of society that your chosen quarries move through. These people might be associated with the criminal underworld, the rough-and-tumble folk of the streets, or members of high society. This connection comes in the form of a contact in any city you visit, a person who provides information about the people and places of the local area.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Use the tables for the criminal background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your bounty hunter's traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a bounty hunter.

For instance, your bond might involve other bounty hunters or the organizations or individuals that employ you. Your ideal could be associated with your determination always to catch your quarry or your desire to maintain your reputation for being dependable.

---

## Feylost

- **Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Survival
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of musical instrument
- **Languages:** One of your choice of Elvish, Gnomish, Goblin, or Sylvan
- **Equipment:** A musical instrument (one of your choice), a *set of traveler's clothes*, three trinkets (each determined by rolling on the *Feywild Trinkets* table), and a *pouch* containing 8 gp

#### Feature: Feywild Connection

Your mannerisms and knowledge of fey customs are recognized by natives of the Feywild, who see you as one of their own. Because of this, friendly Fey creatures are inclined to come to your aid if you are lost or need help in the Feywild.

#### Fey Mark

You were transformed in some small way by your stay in the Feywild and gained a fey mark, determined by rolling on the Fey Mark table.

##### Fey Mark
|  d8 | Fey Mark                                                                                           |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Your eyes swirl with iridescent colors.                                                            |
|  2  | You have a sweet scent, like that of nectar or honey.                                              |
|  3  | You have long whiskers like those of a cat.                                                        |
|  4  | Your ears are covered with soft tufts of fur.                                                      |
|  5  | Your skin sparkles in moonlight.                                                                   |
|  6  | Flowers either bloom or wilt (your choice) in your presence.                                       |
|  7  | Your hair is made of vines or brambles and grows back to normal length within 1 hour of being cut. |
|  8  | You have a tail like that of a dog or another animal.                                              |

#### Feywild Visitor

Whenever you're sound asleep or in a deep trance during a long rest, a spirit of the Feywild might pay you a visit, if the DM wishes it. Determine the spirit's form by rolling on the Feywild Visitor table. No harm ever comes to you as a result of such visits, which can last for minutes or hours, and you remember each visit when you wake up. Conversations that occur with a visitor can contain any number of things, from messages and insights to nonsense and red herrings, at the DM's discretion. Such conversations are always conducted in a language you can understand, even if the Feywild visitor can't speak that language normally.

##### Feywild Visitor
|  d8 | Visitor                                                                                     |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Awakened creature (a Beast or an ordinary plant that has had the *awaken* spell cast on it) |
|  2  | **Centaur**                                                                                 |
|  3  | **Dryad**                                                                                   |
|  4  | **Faerie dragon**                                                                           |
|  5  | **Pixie**                                                                                   |
|  6  | **Satyr**                                                                                   |
|  7  | **Sprite**                                                                                  |
|  8  | **Unicorn**                                                                                 |

##### Character Traits

As the players choose backgrounds for their characters, they can use the following tables to help determine their characters' personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Players can use these tables instead of the ones that appear in the *Player's Handbook*, or they can mix and match them. If a rolled result doesn't make sense for a character, the player can roll again or choose a more appropriate entry on the table.

These tables, while optional, are well suited to Feywild-themed adventures and are ideal for any character who has the feylost or Witchlight hand background.

##### Personality Traits
|  d8 | Trait                                                                                                   |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I'm haunted by fey laughter that only I can hear, though I know it's just my mind playing tricks on me. |
|  2  | Like a nomad, I can't settle down in one place for very long.                                           |
|  3  | Good music makes me weep like a baby.                                                                   |
|  4  | Wherever I go, I try to bring a little of the warmth and tranquility of home with me.                   |
|  5  | I have never lost my childlike sense of wonder.                                                         |
|  6  | When I have a new idea, I get wildly excited about it until I come up with another, better idea.        |
|  7  | I live by my own set of weird and wonderful rules.                                                      |
|  8  | I can't bring myself to trust most adults.                                                              |

##### Ideals
|  d8 | Ideal                                                                                                         |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Friendship. I never leave a friend behind. (Good)                                                             |
|  2  | Empathy. No creature should be made to suffer. (Good)                                                         |
|  3  | Wanderlust. I prefer to take the less traveled path. (Chaotic)                                                |
|  4  | Changeability. Change is good, which is why I live by an ever-changing set of rules. (Chaotic)                |
|  5  | Honor. A deal is a deal, and I would never break one. (Lawful)                                                |
|  6  | Rule of Three. Everything in the multiverse happens in threes. I see the "rule of three" everywhere. (Lawful) |
|  7  | Obsession. I won't let go of a grudge. (Evil)                                                                 |
|  8  | Greed. I will do whatever it takes to get what I want, regardless of the harm it might cause. (Evil)          |

|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I would never break my word.                                                                                           |
|  2  | I find magic in all its forms to be compelling. The more magical a place, the more I am drawn to it.                   |
|  3  | I do what I can to protect the natural world.                                                                          |
|  4  | A trusted friend is the most important thing in the multiverse to me.                                                  |
|  5  | I can't bring myself to harm a Fey creature, either because I consider myself one or because I fear the repercussions. |
|  6  | The Witchlight Carnival feels like home to me.                                                                         |
|  7  | I'm drawn to the Feywild and long to return there, if only for a short while.                                          |
|  8  | I feel indebted to **Mister Witch** and **Mister Light** for giving me a home and a purpose.                           |

##### Flaws
|  d8 | Flaw                                                                                               |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | I easily lose track of time. My poor sense of time means I'm always late.                          |
|  2  | I think the whole multiverse is out to get me.                                                     |
|  3  | I'm always operating under a tight timeline, and I'm obsessed with keeping everything on schedule. |
|  4  | I'm a kleptomaniac who covets shiny, sparkling treasure.                                           |
|  5  | I'm forgetful. Sometimes I can't remember even the simplest things.                                |
|  6  | I never give away anything for free and always expect something in return.                         |
|  7  | I have many vices and tend to indulge them.                                                        |
|  8  | I'm always changing my mind—well, almost always.                                                   |
