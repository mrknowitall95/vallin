## Trencher Bread

**Serves** 2

2 cups whole-wheat flour

¾ cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting

¼ cup stone-ground cornmeal

2½ teaspoons kosher salt

2½ teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon baking soda

1¼ cups whole milk or low-fat Greek yogurt (not nonfat)

⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil

3 tablespoons neutral oil

Brushing the breads with extra-virgin olive oil or melted butter while they're still warm is a nice touch.

Lightly flour a work surface. In a large bowl, combine the whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, cornmeal, salt, baking powder, and baking soda and whisk to incorporate. Make a well in the center, add the milk and olive oil, and, using a wooden spoon or your hands, stir around the perimeter of the well to incorporate the dry ingredients into the wet (the dough will look a little rough and shaggy). Scrape the dough onto the prepared work surface and knead until smooth and uniform, dusting with a tiny amount of all-purpose flour as you go if the dough becomes too sticky. Divide the dough into four equal portions. Gently roll each portion into a ball, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let rest for 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 125°F.

Using a rolling pin, roll out one of the dough balls into a circle with an 11-inch diameter. In a 12-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium heat, warm about 2 teaspoons of the neutral oil until hot. Tilt the skillet to coat the bottom with oil, carefully place the dough circle in the skillet, and cook, undisturbed, until spotted with brown on the bottom and slightly puffed, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the round over and continue to cook, undisturbed, until the second side is spotty brown as well, 3 to 4 minutes longer. Transfer the bread to a baking sheet or ovenproof plate and place it in the oven to keep warm. One at a time, roll and cook the remaining rounds, adding the remaining 1 tablespoon neutral oil and adjusting the heat if necessary to avoid burning, and transferring them to the oven keep warm. Serve immediately.
