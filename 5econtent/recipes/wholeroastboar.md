## Whole Roast Boar

**Serves** 8 to 10

3 tablespoons light brown sugar

3 tablespoons kosher salt

1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper

One 8-pound whole bone-in pork butt (also known as shoulder butt), skinned, with fat cap attached

2 to 3 cups water, plus more as needed

#### Port Sauce

2 tablespoons reserved pork fat (from above)

½ cup minced shallots

1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme

Kosher salt

2 tablespoons tomato paste

1 cup ruby port

¾ cup low-sodium chicken broth

2 tablespoons red currant jam

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1½ teaspoons sherry vinegar

Freshly ground black pepper

In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, salt, and pepper and whisk to blend. Using a very sharp knife, cut slits about 1 inch apart in a crosshatch pattern across the entire fat cap of the pork, taking care to cut all the way through the layer of fat, but not into the meat beneath it. Sprinkle the brown sugar-salt mixture all over the pork, making sure to rub it into the slits. Wrap the meat tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours.

With a rack in the lowest position, preheat the oven to 325°F. Coat a roasting rack with nonstick cooking spray and set it in a large roasting pan.

Unwrap the pork and, with paper towels, blot the surface dry and remove any excess salt mixture if it hasn't completely dissolved. Place the pork on the prepared roasting rack, fat cap-side up, and pour the water into the pan, making sure it does not touch the bottom of the pork. Roast until the pork is very tender (a paring knife should slip in and out of the meat very easily) and the meat near the bone (but not touching it) registers 190°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 hours, checking once or twice on the water level in the roasting pan. If there is less than ¾ cup, add more. Transfer the pork to a platter or carving board, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 30 minutes. Pour the liquid from the roasting pan into a fat separator or a narrow, heatproof container, and allow it to settle for 10 minutes. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the fat for the sauce and discard the rest.

If desired, make extra-crisp cracklings by raising the oven temperature to 475°F and returning the rested pork to the roasting pan, fat cap-side up. Roast until the cracklings are dark, blistered, and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Return the pork to the platter or carving board, cover loosely with foil, and let rest for 15 minutes longer.

Cut the pork into thick slices, or using a fork, gently pull apart into small chunks. Arrange on a serving platter and cover with foil until the sauce is finished.

***To make the port sauce:.*** In a medium skillet over medium heat, warm the reserved pork fat until shimmering. Add the shallots, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant and a shade darker, about 1½ minutes. Add the port, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a strong simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced by a little less than half, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken broth (and any juices accumulated from the rested pork), return the mixture to a strong simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced again by slightly less than half, about 3 minutes longer. Adjust the heat to medium, add the jam, and whisk vigorously until dissolved and incorporated. Remove the skillet from the heat, add the butter and vinegar, and whisk to incorporate. Season generously with pepper and whisk to incorporate. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

Serve the pork and sauce together.
