## Stuffed Egg-Battered Toast

**Serves** 4

4 ounces (½ cup) mascarpone, at room temperature

¼ cup walnuts, finely chopped

2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

4 (1-inch-thick) slices brioche or challah

2 eggs

½ cup whole milk

¼ teaspoon kosher salt

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

½ cup maple syrup

Confectioners' sugar for dusting

Stuffing the mascarpone mixture into the thick slices of brioche requires a delicate touch (or small fingers). If creating a pocket in the side of each slice is too much trouble, you can also cut the bread ½ inch thick and spread the mascarpone in between two slices, like a sandwich.

Marmalade, heated over low heat in a pan, makes for a delectable syrup replacement.

In a small bowl, stir together the mascarpone, walnuts, and vanilla.

Use a thin knife to cut a 2-inch-long slit through the side of each slice of brioche, creating a pocket. Gently open the pocket and spoon about 1 tablespoon of the mascarpone mixture into each slice.

In a pie dish or shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and salt.

Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Dip two stuffed slices into the egg mixture, turning to soak both sides and letting any excess batter drip back into the bowl. Place the slices in the skillet and cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side, until golden brown. Use a spatula to transfer the toasts to a warm plate. Repeat to cook the remaining two stuffed slices.

Meanwhile, warm the maple syrup in a small saucepan over low heat for a few minutes.

Dust the stuffed toast with confectioners' sugar, drizzle with the warm maple syrup, and serve.
