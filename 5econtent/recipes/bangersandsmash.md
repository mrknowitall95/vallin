## Bangers and Smash

**Serves** 4

1½ pounds (about 16) small red-skinned or Yukon gold creamer potatoes, scrubbed

½ cup extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 leeks, white and light green parts, halved lengthwise and cut into 1-inch pieces

4 to 8 fresh or fully cooked chicken or pork sausages (breakfast sausages or any flavor of your choice)

1 pound large cherry tomatoes

2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Preheat the oven to 450°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.

On a large rimmed baking sheet, roast the potatoes until very tender, about 40 minutes.

Remove the baking sheet from the oven (leave the oven on) and set aside to cool, about 10 minutes. Transfer the potatoes to a bowl, brush the baking sheet with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and sprinkle the sheet lightly with salt and pepper. Return the potatoes to the baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart. With the bottom of a mug or another baking sheet (to do all the potatoes at once), sharply press down on the potatoes to break their skins and compress the flesh to a thickness of about 1 inch (do not smash them thinner). Brush the potatoes with 2 tablespoons olive oil, return them to the oven, and continue to roast for 15 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, turn the potatoes over, and rearrange them over about half the baking sheet.

In the now-empty bowl, toss the leeks with 3 tablespoons olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and spread them on the empty side of the baking sheet. Add the sausages to the now-empty bowl, add 1½ teaspoons olive oil, and toss to coat. Arrange the sausages over the leeks.

Roast for 8 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, move the sausages to the side, stir the leeks, spread them over about two-thirds of the empty space on the baking sheet, and replace the sausages over the leeks.

In the now-empty bowl, toss the tomatoes with the remaining 1½ teaspoons oil to coat. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper and toss again. Spread the tomatoes in the empty space on the baking sheet and continue to roast until the skins burst, the sausages are warmed through, and the potatoes are crisp, about 10 minutes more.

Transfer the potatoes, tomatoes, sausages, and leeks to a serving platter, sprinkle with the parsley, and serve.
