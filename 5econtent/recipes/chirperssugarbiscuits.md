## Chirper's Sugar Biscuits

**Makes** 12 buns

¼ cup granulated sugar

1 tablespoon finely grated lemon zest

3 tablespoons packed light or dark brown sugar

¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon

½ teaspoon ground cardamom

1 pinch kosher salt

1 sheet frozen all-butter puff pastry (see Cook's Notes), thawed according to package directions and still cool

2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus 2 tablespoons melted

The dimensions of puff pastry sheets vary by brand, so depending on which one you use, you may or may not have to roll it to the required length. Regardless, make sure your pastry is completely thawed, so you can unfold it initially, and roll it up with the filling, without it cracking. It should still be cool, though, because warm puff pastry can become sticky. Finally, don't allow the baked buns to cool completely in the muffin tin, or they will stick to the cups.

All that said, don't allow all this information daunt you. The buns are, in fact, easy to form and bake, and easier yet to eat. On that note, they're best within a couple of hours of baking. You can, however, re-crisp them with about a 5-minute stay in a 350°F oven.

In a medium bowl, combine 2 tablespoons of the granulated sugar and the lemon zest and stir until the sugar is moist and fragrant. Add the brown sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, and salt and stir to mix thoroughly. Set aside 2 tablespoons of the mixture.

Place a sheet of parchment paper on your work surface and evenly sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar over it. On the sugared paper, unfold the puff pastry (which should be rectangular) and, if it is less than 15 inches long, place a second parchment sheet over it and use a rolling pin to gently roll it to that length (taking care not to press too hard, which compresses the layers, decreasing their puff when baked). Remove the top parchment sheet. If necessary, using your fingers, gently loosen the long edge of the pastry nearest you from the bottom piece of parchment paper (this will make it easier to begin rolling it with the filling). Evenly spread the room-temperature butter over the pastry and sprinkle the larger quantity of the sugar mixture over the butter, all the way to the edges. Lay a piece of parchment paper over the sugar mixture, gently press down to help the mixture adhere, and remove the parchment.

Starting with the long side that you loosened, gently roll the pastry into a very tight, even, compact cylinder. Pinch the seam along the entire length of the cylinder to seal (it may pop open as the buns bake, which is fine). Slide the cylinder and the parchment sheet it's on onto a large baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm, about 45 minutes.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 400°F. Coat the cups of a standard muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray, and set aside.

Remove the plastic from the pastry, place the cylinder seam-side down on a cutting board, and, using a serrated knife in a sawing motion, cut the cylinder in half crosswise. Cut each half into sixths and place, cut-side up, in a prepared muffin cup.

Bake the buns until puffed and dark golden brown, about 20 minutes, rotating the muffin tin about halfway through. Remove the buns from the oven and, working quickly, brush with the melted butter and sprinkle each with about ½ teaspoon of the reserved sugar mixture. Let cool for 3 minutes, then carefully remove the buns from the muffin tin while still hot. Let cool on the rack to room temperature (they'll crisp up more as they cool) before serving.
