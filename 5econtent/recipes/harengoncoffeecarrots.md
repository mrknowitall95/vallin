## Harengon Coffee Carrots

**Serves** 4

1½ pounds carrots, peeled and sliced on the diagonal ⅜ inch thick

⅓ cup espresso or strong brewed coffee

1½ tablespoons molasses (not blackstrap)

Kosher salt

1½ tablespoons unsalted butter

1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme

¾ teaspoon balsamic vinegar

¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

Freshly ground black pepper

2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

In a medium nonstick skillet (with a lid) over medium-high heat, combine the carrots, espresso, molasses, and ¾ teaspoon salt and bring to a strong simmer. Cover, adjust the heat to medium, and let simmer, stirring occasionally, until the carrots feel almost tender when poked with the tip of a paring knife, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the butter and thyme, adjust the heat to high, and cook at a slow boil, uncovered, stirring to incorporate the butter as it melts, until the liquid is reduced to about 3 tablespoons and the carrots are tender and glazed, 4 to 5 minutes longer.

Remove the skillet from the heat, add the vinegar and vanilla, season with pepper, and stir to blend. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Scrape the carrots and glaze into a serving dish and sprinkle with the parsley. Serve immediately.
