## Dark Molasses Nutbread

**Makes** one 8½-inch loaf

¾ cup all-purpose flour

¾ cup rye flour

¾ cup fine or medium-ground yellow cornmeal

¾ teaspoon baking soda

½ teaspoon baking powder

1 teaspoon kosher salt

1½ cups coarsely chopped toasted walnuts

1 cup buttermilk

½ cup unsulphured molasses (not blackstrap)

¼ cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled

Rye flour is available from Bob's Red Mill and is sometimes found in the bulk department of a supermarket or natural foods store.

Preheat the oven to 350°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Butter and flour an 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pan and tap out the excess (or coat with nonstick baking spray).

In a bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, rye flour, cornmeal, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Add the walnuts and stir to distribute.

In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, molasses, and melted butter (the butter will clump, which is fine).

Make a well in the center of the dry mixture, add the wet mixture, and, using a flexible spatula, fold and stir until the wet and dry ingredients are just incorporated (do not overmix). Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.

Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through, until the loaf is firm to the touch, the edges pull away from the pan slightly, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Cool the bread in the pan on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Turn out the loaf, place it right-side up on the rack, and cool to room temperature. To serve, slice with a serrated knife.
