## Elven Flatbread

**Makes** one 13 by 9-inch focaccia

3 cups all-purpose flour or bread flour

1 packet (2¼ teaspoons) instant or Rapid Rise yeast

2 teaspoons kosher salt

1¾ cups lukewarm (105° to 115°F) water

5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

1 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature

Vegetables (such as halved cherry or grape tomatoes, sliced shallots or red onions, sliced mini bell peppers, and scallions)

Fresh herbs for garnish (such as parsley or basil sprigs)

Sliced black olives for garnish (optional)

Large-flake salt (such as Maldon)

In a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast, and kosher salt and whisk to incorporate. Make a well in the center, add the water and, using a wooden spoon or your hands, stir around the perimeter of the well to incorporate the dry ingredients into the wet, creating a mass of sticky dough (it will look a little lumpy, which is fine). Pour 1½ teaspoons of the olive oil over the dough, and turn the dough to coat lightly. Cover the bowl and refrigerate until the dough has about doubled in bulk, at least 12 hours or up to 48 hours.

A couple of hours before you're ready to bake, coat a 13 by 9-inch baking dish with the butter and then with nonstick cooking spray. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to the center of the dish and tilt to spread the oil. Pull the dough away from the sides of the bowl to deflate. Place in the prepared baking dish, roll in the oil to coat well, and re-shape it into a loose ball. Cover and let rest at room temperature until doubled in bulk, 2½ to 4 hours (timing will depend on the ambient temperature).

When ready to top and bake, with a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 425°F. Pour 2 tablespoons olive oil over the dough and spread evenly over the surface. Using your fingers, gently stretch the dough toward the edges of the pan (ideally it will come within an inch or two) while pressing into it with your fingertips to create deep dimples, though not all the way to the bottom. Arrange the vegetables on the dough decoratively in a single layer, pressing them into the dough to help adhere. Brush with the remaining 1½ teaspoons olive oil, garnish with herbs and olives (if using), and sprinkle as much flaky salt as you like evenly over the surface.

Bake the flatbread until golden brown, puffed on the top, and crisp on the bottom, 28 to 40 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Place the pan on a wire rack to cool for 15 minutes. Carefully remove the bread from the pan, transfer to the rack, and let cool until just warm. Cut and serve.
