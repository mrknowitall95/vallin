## Goodberry Blend

**Serves** 4

½ cup ice cubes

1½ cups orange juice

1 cup packed baby spinach

3 tablespoons honey

Pinch of kosher salt

2 cups frozen blueberries, partially thawed

1 sliced banana, frozen

For a more robust flavor, consider adding 1–2 tablespoons of fresh ginger to the blend.

Put the ice in a blender and pulse to crush. Add the orange juice, spinach, honey, and salt; pulse to begin breaking up the greens. Blend to liquefy the solids, 20 to 60 seconds, depending on your blender. Add the blueberries and banana and blend until the mixture is uniform, thick, and moves easily in the blender jar, about 45 seconds. Pour into four cups and serve immediately.
