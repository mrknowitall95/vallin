## Rollrum

**Serves** 2

1½ tablespoons sugar

1½ ounces water

20 large mint leaves, plus 2 sprigs for garnish

Small ice cubes or coarsely crushed ice

4 ounces absinthe

4 ounces seltzer, cold (optional)

Although less potent in terms of alcohol content, you can substitute other anise-flavored liqueurs, such as pastis, Pernod, Herbsaint, or even ouzo, for the absinthe.

In a cocktail shaker, muddle the sugar and water until the sugar dissolves and the liquid is syrupy. Add the mint leaves and muddle gently to bruise them and release their fragrance (do not pulverize). Fill the shaker about halfway with ice and add the absinthe. Cover and shake to blend and chill, 30 seconds. Fill two chilled old-fashioned, rocks, or small Collins glasses about halfway with ice and divide the mixture between them. If using, add half the seltzer to each and stir gently to blend. Holding the mint sprigs by their stems, slap them against the back of your hand or forearm (to help release their fragrance), garnish each glass with a sprig, and serve at once.
