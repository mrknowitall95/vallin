## Smoked Sausages and Kraut with Dwarven Mustard

**Serves** 6

3 tablespoons vegetable oil

1 yellow onion, finely chopped

1 large apple, peeled, cored, and cut into ½-inch pieces

1 teaspoon sugar

1 teaspoon juniper berries (optional)

4 cups sauerkraut, drained, rinsed,and squeezed dry

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1½ cups water

2 cups dark beer

6 smoked sausages, such as kielbasa or bratwurst

½ cup stone-ground mustard

¼ cup sour cream

In a large pot over medium-low heat, warm the vegetable oil. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until completely soft and starting to caramelize, about 15 minutes. Add the apple, sugar, juniper berries (if using), sauerkraut, water, ½ teaspoon salt, and several grinds of pepper. Cover the pot and cook until the apple is soft, 25 to 35 minutes.

Meanwhile, bring the beer to a simmer in a wide saucepan. Poke the sausages in several places with a fork. Add them to the pan with the beer and cook until warmed through, 5 to 10 minutes.

In a small bowl, stir together the mustard and sour cream.

Spoon some of the sauerkraut mixture onto each serving plate. Use tongs to place a sausage on top. If you'd like the sauerkraut to be a little saucier, spoon 1 to 2 tablespoons of the warm beer over the top. Serve with the mustard mixture on the side.
