## Dwarven Mulled Wine

**Serves** 4

2 juice oranges, such as Valencia

8 whole cloves

⅓ cup packed light brown sugar, or to taste

1 (750-ml) bottle medium-bodied, fruity red wine, such as Merlot or Syrah

1 cinnamon stick

⅛ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

3 tablespoons brandy, or to taste

The flavor of mulled wine improves with rest, so consider starting it several hours ahead of time. Reheat it gently, careful to avoid boiling (which can cause an oxidized taste), then remove the aromatics and add the vanilla and brandy.

Mulled wine recipes vary widely. This one is heavy on the orange, light on the spice and sweetener, and includes brandy for a modest potency boost. However, it can be customized with different liqueurs such as Grand Marnier, Cointreau, or St-Germain, and spices such as cardamom pods, black peppercorns, or whole allspice.

Using a vegetable peeler, remove the zest from the oranges in wide strips; reserve one strip for each drink and refrigerate, covered, until serving time. Stick the cloves into two or three of the remaining zest strips and set aside. Cut the zested oranges in half and juice them (which should yield about ¾ cup juice).

In a large saucepan over medium heat, bring the orange juice and brown sugar to a simmer, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Add the wine, cinnamon stick, and orange zest (including the clove-studded pieces) and bring to a simmer. Adjust the heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered and stirring occasionally, until the wine is fragrant and infused, about 1 hour (do not allow it to boil). Add the vanilla and brandy and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, to blend the flavors, about 2 minutes more. Taste and adjust the flavor with additional brown sugar and/or brandy, if necessary. With a slotted spoon, remove and discard the cinnamon stick, orange zest, and cloves.

Meanwhile, fill one small mug or heatproof glass for each drinker with hot water to preheat them, about 2 minutes. Empty the mugs or glasses, ladle some of the wine into each, garnish with one of the reserved orange zest strips, and serve at once.
