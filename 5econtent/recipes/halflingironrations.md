## Halfling Iron Rations

**Makes** about 4 cups

1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats

½ cup slivered almonds

½ cup coarsely chopped walnuts

½ cup raw pepitas

1½ tablespoons flaxseed

1½ tablespoons sesame seeds

1 egg white

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce

3 tablespoons packed light brown sugar

1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme

1½ teaspoons kosher salt

¾ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

¾ teaspoon paprika

¾ teaspoon garlic powder

¾ teaspoon ground coriander

1 pinch cayenne pepper

Great as a snack, iron rations also make an excellent crunchy topping for thick soups such as Seelie Court Cheese and Potato Soup, salads, roasted vegetables, ratatouille, avocado toast, and deviled eggs.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 325°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat and set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the oats, almonds, walnuts, pepitas, flaxseed, and sesame seeds and stir to mix. In another medium bowl, combine the egg white, olive oil, Worcestershire, brown sugar, thyme, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, coriander, and cayenne and whisk vigorously until well blended. Pour the liquid mixture over the dry mixture and, using a flexible spatula, fold and stir until all the dry ingredients are well coated. Scrape the seed-oat mixture into the center of the prepared baking sheet and, using a large metal spatula, spread and firmly press into an even layer, roughly ⅜ inch thick (the shape is unimportant). The mixture will stick to the spatula as you work—simply scrape it off and continue.

Bake the granola until golden brown in the center and a little darker around the edges, about 25 minutes, rotating the pan about halfway through. Using the metal spatula, turn the granola; it will break into shards as you work, which is fine, but try to keep them as large as possible. Redistribute the granola into an even layer and continue to bake until it is deep golden brown, about 5 minutes longer. Let the granola cool to room temperature on the baking sheet (it will crisp further as it cools). If desired, break it into smaller pieces.

Store the granola in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.
