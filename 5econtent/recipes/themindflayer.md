## The Mindflayer

**Serves** 2

3 tablespoons peeled and chopped fresh ginger

¼ cup sugar

⅓ cup fresh lime juice

½ cup thawed grape juice concentrate

5 ounces vodka, cold

3 cups small ice cubes or coarsely crushed ice

Several black or red seedless grapes for garnish (optional)

In a blender, combine the ginger, sugar, and lime juice until the solids are a very, very fine puree and the mixture is uniformly syrupy, about 1 minute. Set a fine-mesh strainer over a measuring cup or bowl and strain the mixture, stirring and pressing on the solids to extract as much syrup as possible (you should have about ½ cup). Discard the solids and return the syrup to the blender.

Add the grape juice concentrate, vodka, and ice and blend until the ice is finely crushed and the mixture is uniform and moves easily in the blender jar (the timing will depend on the power of your blender). Divide the mixture between two roomy highball or Collins glasses, garnish with the grapes (if using), and serve at once, with straws if desired.
