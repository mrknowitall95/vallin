## Zzar

**Serves** 2

¼ cup heavy cream, cold

1 teaspoon confectioners' or granulated sugar

3½ ounces amaretto

Small ice cubes

1½ ounces coffee-flavored liqueur, such as Kahlua

½ cup whole milk

The ice in the shaker provides sufficient dilution, especially since there are no hard spirits in the cocktail, which is why the quantity of ice in the glasses is limited.

Using an electric handheld mixer, a whisk, or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the cream and sugar together until thickened and the whisk just begins to leave a trail. Add ½ ounce of the amaretto and beat briefly, until the cream is very softly whipped; refrigerate until needed.

Fill a cocktail shaker about halfway with ice and add the remaining 3 ounces amaretto, the coffee liqueur, and milk. Cover and shake to blend and chill, 30 seconds. Place two ice cubes in each of two chilled old-fashioned or rocks glasses and divide the mixture between them. Very gently spoon a portion of the whipped cream into each glass so it floats on the surface of the liquid and serve at once.
