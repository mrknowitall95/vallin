## Spiced Pork and Orange Peppers

**Serves** 4

½ teaspoon paprika

½ teaspoon ground coriander

½ teaspoon ground fennel

½ teaspoon garlic powder

¼ teaspoon ground cumin

⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper (or more if you like it hot)

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 large pork tenderloin (1½ pounds), silverskin removed (see Cook's Note), and patted dry with paper towels

3 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

1 large yellow onion, halved from pole to pole and sliced lengthwise

4 large orange bell peppers, cored, seeded, and cut into ¾-inch-wide strips

5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced

1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme

2 teaspoons sherry, cider, or wine vinegar, plus more as needed

⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley

Silverskin is a light-colored (silvery) membrane on the meat that contracts when cooked. It can be removed with a sharp paring knife.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 425°F.

In a small bowl, combine the paprika, coriander, fennel, garlic powder, cumin, cayenne, ¾ teaspoon salt, and ¾ teaspoon black pepper and stir to incorporate. Rub the pork with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, then sprinkle the spice mixture all over the meat, rubbing it into the surface.

In a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon olive oil until shimmering. Add the pork, adjust the heat to medium, and cook until browned all over, giving it a quarter turn every 1½ minutes (adjusting the heat as necessary if the pan drippings threaten to scorch) until all four sides are cooked, about 6 minutes total. Transfer the tenderloin to a plate and set aside.

Return the skillet to medium heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, and let warm for a moment (taking care not to scorch the caramelized bits left in the skillet). Add the onion, bell peppers, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release the caramelized bits as the vegetables release moisture, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking until the vegetables just begin to soften, about 3 minutes longer. Add the garlic and thyme and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Return the pork to the skillet, positioning it over the vegetables.

Place the skillet in the oven and roast the meat until the center registers 140°F on an instant-read thermometer, 12 to 17 minutes, turning the tenderloin over midway through cooking. Transfer the tenderloin to a carving board, cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 145° to 150°F, 5 to 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, turn off the oven and return the skillet with its vegetables to the oven to keep warm.

When the meat has almost finished resting, remove the skillet from the oven. Stir in the vinegar and most of the parsley. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, then scrape the vegetables onto a serving platter. Cut the pork on the diagonal into slices about ½ inch thick and arrange them over the vegetables. Sprinkle lightly with salt, pepper, and the remaining parsley before serving.
