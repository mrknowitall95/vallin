## Fried Fingers

**Serves** 4

#### Plum Sauce

1 tablespoon neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

¼ cup finely chopped scallion whites

Kosher salt

2 teaspoons finely grated fresh ginger

1 large garlic clove, finely chopped

¼ teaspoon five-spice powder

1 cup plum jam or preserves

1½ tablespoons plain rice vinegar

1 tablespoon soy sauce

1 tablespoon light brown sugar

Freshly ground black pepper

#### Chicken Fingers

ups panko bread crumbs

3 cups packed kettle-cooked potato chips (about 5 ounces), crushed to fine crumbs

2 teaspoons dry mustard powder

2 teaspoons garlic powder

Pinch of cayenne, or to taste

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

½ cup all-purpose flour

2 eggs

4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (6 to 8 ounces each), cut on the lengthwise diagonal into ¾-inch-wide strips

Olive oil cooking spray

A good method for crushing the potato chips is to put them in a resealable bag and roll over it repeatedly with a rolling pin until the chips are finely crushed.

***Make the Sauce.*** In a small saucepan over medium heat, warm the oil until shimmering. Add the scallion whites and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the ginger, garlic, and five-spice powder and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the jam, vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, and pepper to taste and whisk to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring, 3 to 5 minutes. Adjust the heat to low and continue simmering and stirring to blend the flavors, about 1 minute. Scrape the sauce into a microwave-safe container and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 325°F with a rack in the upper-middle of the oven. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil.

***Make the Chicken Fingers.*** Spread the panko in an even layer on the foil-lined baking sheet and bake until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring several times. Scrape the toasted panko into a wide, shallow dish, add the crushed potato chips, mustard powder, garlic powder, cayenne, 1¼ teaspoons salt, and a few grinds of pepper. Stir to distribute the potato chips and seasonings. In a second wide, shallow dish, spread the flour. In a third wide shallow dish, whisk the eggs, a pinch of salt, and a few grinds of pepper until well blended.

Adjust the oven temperature to 500°F and fit a wire rack into the foil-lined baking sheet.

Blot dry the chicken strips and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Working with several pieces of chicken at a time, dredge them in the flour and tap off any excess. Dip the floured chicken pieces into the egg mixture to coat thoroughly, allow any excess egg to drip off. Then dredge them in the panko mixture to coat thoroughly, pressing it onto the chicken to help it adhere. Carefully transfer the chicken pieces to the rack on the baking sheet (they should not overlap) and coat them with cooking spray.

Bake until the coating is deep golden brown and crisp and the chicken fingers are cooked through (they will feel firm when squeezed gently with your fingertips), 10 to 12 minutes, checking them frequently, turning them over and coating the second side midway through the cooking time and rotating the pan 180 degrees for even cooking. Cool the chicken fingers for about 4 minutes.

If the sauce has cooled completely and you want to serve it warm, cover the dish, and microwave briefly to reheat. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve the fried fingers hot, passing the sauce on the side.
