## Bytopian Shepherd's Bread

**Makes** one 8½-inch loaf

2 cups all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon baking soda

2 teaspoons ground ginger

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

½ teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg

1 teaspoon kosher salt

½ cup currants

3 eggs

¾ cup packed light brown sugar

¼ cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled

⅓ cup buttermilk

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

1 pound carrots, peeled and coarsely grated (about 3 cups)

½ cup slivered or sliced almonds

Preheat the oven to 350°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Lightly oil or butter a 8½ by 4½-inch nonstick loaf pan.

In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt to combine. Add the currants and stir to distribute.

In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and brown sugar until well blended. Add the melted butter and whisk to combine thoroughly. Add the buttermilk and vanilla extract and whisk to combine thoroughly. Stir in the carrots. Add the dry mixture and, using a flexible spatula, fold and stir until the wet and dry ingredients are just incorporated; do not overmix. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Sprinkle the almonds evenly over the batter and press them very lightly to help them adhere.

Bake until the almonds on top are golden, the edges of the loaf pull away from the pan, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 55 minutes, rotating the pan 180 degrees midway through the baking time.

Cool the pan on a wire rack for about 15 minutes. Turn the loaf out, place it right-side up onto the rack, cool to room temperature, and serve.
