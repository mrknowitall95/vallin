## Cherrybread

**Makes** one 9-inch loaf

¾ cup golden raisins

2 tablespoons dark or amber rum

¾ cup all-purpose flour

½ teaspoon baking powder

¼ teaspoon baking soda

Kosher salt

⅓ cup packed light brown sugar

1⅓ cups packed dried apricot halves

¾ cup dried cherries or cranberries

3 cups walnut halves, lightly toasted and cooled

3 eggs

2 tablespoons unsulphured molasses (not blackstrap)

½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

If you vary the type of dried fruit used, cut larger ones, like dates or figs, into smaller pieces. Make sure to include cherries or cranberries for the tart edge to their sweetness. This bread is an excellent accompaniment to a cheese platter.

In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine the raisins and rum, cover, and microwave until warm, about 1 minute. Set the bowl aside, still covered, until the raisins absorb most of the rum and soften, about 1 hour, stirring once or twice during that time. Drain off any excess liquid.

Preheat the oven to 300°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Butter a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan. Fold two long sheets of parchment paper and lay one crosswise in the pan and lay one lengthwise, pushing the parchment paper into the corners and smoothing the paper so it lies flush in the pan, with the ends overhanging all four sides of the pan. Generously butter the parchment paper in the pan.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, ½ teaspoon salt, and the brown sugar (make sure to break up any lumps in the brown sugar). Add the apricots, cherries, and raisins and toss to coat well. Add the walnuts and toss to combine.

In a small bowl, beat together the eggs, molasses, and vanilla until well blended. Add to the fruit-nut mixture and, using a flexible spatula, fold and mix to combine and coat all the dried fruit and nut pieces with batter (make sure there are no pockets of dry ingredients left at the bottom of the bowl). Scrape the mixture into the prepared pan and smooth it into an even, compact layer.

Bake for about 1 hour, rotating the pan 180 degrees halfway through. If, at that time, the top is browning too much, tent loosely with foil. When the cake is a deep golden brown, transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool completely.

Grab the parchment paper overhangs and remove the loaf from the pan. With a serrated knife, cut it into thin slices, and serve. Leftovers can be wrapped well and stored in an airtight container at room temperature for about 1 week.
