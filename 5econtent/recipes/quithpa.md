## Quith-pa

**Makes** 15 or 16 balls

1 orange

6 ounces (1 cup) dried apricots, coarsely chopped

¾ cup unsweetened shredded coconut, toasted

¾ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Kosher salt

Using a Microplane, grate the orange peel to yield 1½ teaspoons of finely grated zest. Squeeze the orange to yield 1½ tablespoons of juice.

In a full-size or mini food processor, combine the apricots, ¼ cup of the coconut, the orange zest and juice, vanilla, and a tiny pinch of salt. Process until the mixture is very finely chopped, uniform, and cohesive, pulsing and stopping to scrape down the sides of the work bowl as necessary. Scrape the mixture into a small bowl. Put the remaining ½ cup coconut in a wide, shallow bowl.

Roll scant 1-tablespoon portions of the apricot mixture into 1-inch balls, gently pressing as you roll to help them cohere (you should have 15 or 16 balls). Working with three or four balls at a time, roll them in the remaining coconut, pressing them gently to help the coconut adhere. Place the balls on a plate and rest them (to firm up and dry out slightly) for 45 minutes. The balls will keep, stored in an airtight container at room temperature, for about 3 days.
