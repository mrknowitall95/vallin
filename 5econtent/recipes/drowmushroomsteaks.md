## Drow Mushroom Steaks

**Serves** 6

3 tablespoons olive oil

2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar

1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves

½ teaspoon kosher salt

Freshly ground black pepper

6 large portobello mushrooms caps (stems removed and discarded)

In a shallow dish wide enough to hold the mushrooms in a single layer, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, thyme, salt, and several grinds of pepper. Put the mushrooms in the dish. Set aside to marinate at room temperature for 15 minutes, turning the mushrooms over and spooning the marinade on them halfway through.

Heat an outdoor grill or indoor grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the mushrooms, flipping to cook both sides, until tender and browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature.
