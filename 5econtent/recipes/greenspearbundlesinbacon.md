## Greenspear Bundles in Bacon

**Serves** 4

2 pounds (about 32) medium-thick asparagus spears, tough ends snapped off

1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

8 slices bacon

1½ tablespoons finely chopped fresh chives for garnish

When choosing asparagus, seek spears that are about ¾ inch thick at the base—about as thick as a highlighter; they will overcook if they are too slender (like a pencil).

If you prefer crispier bacon, use standard-cut instead of thick-cut bacon.

Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.

In a large bowl, toss the asparagus with the olive oil to coat. Sprinkle the asparagus very lightly with salt and pepper and toss again.

Put one slice of bacon on the work surface, lay four asparagus spears on it diagonally, and wrap the bacon around the asparagus, covering as much of the spears as possible and making sure the ends overlap; gently press the ends together to help them adhere. Working in groups of four asparagus spears, repeat with the remaining bacon slices and asparagus to form seven additional bundles.

On a large rimmed baking sheet, arrange the bundles, seam-side down, with about 1 inch of space around them. Roast until the bacon and asparagus are cooked through and spotted brown, about 15 minutes.

Transfer the bundles to a serving platter, sprinkle with the chives, and serve at once.
