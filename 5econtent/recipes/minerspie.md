## Miner's Pie

**Serves** 4 to 6

#### Filling

1½ tablespoons olive oil

1 yellow onion, chopped

1 large leek, white and light green parts, halved lengthwise and cut into ¾-inch pieces

1 bay leaf

Kosher salt

2 pounds ground beef

3 garlic cloves, finely chopped

2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme

4 tablespoons tomato paste

3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

½ cup ale, such as IPA

1 cup low-sodium chicken broth

¾ cup frozen corn, thawed

¾ cup frozen peas, thawed

¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

Freshly ground black pepper

#### Topping

3 pounds russet potatoes, peeled, cut into 1-inch chunks, and rinsed well

3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

⅔ cup whole milk or half-and-half

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

2 eggs, beaten

¾ cup coarsely grated Monterey Jack or Colby cheese

***Make the Filling.*** In a very large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onion, leek, bay leaf, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the ground beef and cook, stirring and breaking up any clumps, until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme, and tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Adjust the heat to medium, add the flour, and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes, until the flour is completely blended in. Add the ale, broth, and ¾ teaspoon salt. Adjust the heat to high and bring to a simmer, using a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the skillet to loosen and dissolve any browned bits stuck to the pan, about 1 minute. Adjust the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the skillet occasionally, until the filling is thickened but still saucy, about 15 minutes.

Add the corn and peas and set the skillet aside, off the heat to cool slightly. Remove the bay leaf, add most of the parsley, and stir to mix. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, if necessary, and pepper to taste. Scrape the mixture into a broiler-safe 2-quart casserole dish, spread evenly, and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 450°F with a rack in the upper-middle of the oven.

***Meanwhile, Make the Topping.*** Put the potatoes in a steaming basket. Fill a Dutch oven or large saucepan with enough water to just reach the bottom of the steaming basket and bring to a boil over high heat. Set the steamer basket in the pot, cover, adjust the heat to medium-high, and cook until the potatoes are very tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the steamer basket and pour the water out of the pot.

Set a potato ricer over the pot and rice the potatoes into it. Add the melted butter and stir it into the potatoes. Add the milk, 1½ teaspoons salt, pepper to taste, and the Parmesan and stir to incorporate. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary, and set aside to cool for about 20 minutes.

Add the eggs to the potatoes and stir to incorporate. Spoon the potatoes over the filling, spreading them evenly and making sure they reach to the edges of the casserole dish. Sprinkle evenly with the Monterey Jack. Place the dish on a large baking sheet and bake until the filling is heated through and the potatoes are puffed slightly, about 20 minutes.

Turn on the broiler and cook until the top is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley and serve hot.
