## Breaded Bird Cutlets

**Serves** 4

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

½ cup all-purpose flour

2 eggs

1 tablespoon water

4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts (about 7 ounces each), tenderloins removed, trimmed of fat

⅓ cup neutral oil

⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil

3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cold

¼ cup minced shallot

2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme

½ cup dry vermouth or dry white wine

1 cup low-sodium chicken broth

½ lemon, thinly sliced

3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 200°F. Place a wire rack on a large-rimmed baking sheet and set aside.

In a small bowl, combine 2½ teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper, stir to incorporate, and set aside.

Put the flour in a wide, shallow dish, such as a pie plate. In another wide, shallow dish, beat the eggs with the water. Set both dishes aside.

On a work surface, using a sharp knife, cut each chicken breast in half horizontally to make eight cutlets. Cover them with plastic wrap and use a meat pounder or the bottom of a small skillet to pound the thicker ends so the cutlets have an even thickness of ¼ to ½ inch. Remove the plastic, sprinkle the cutlets evenly with the salt-pepper mixture, and set aside to rest for 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, combine the neutral oil and olive oil and warm until shimmering.

Dredge two cutlets in the flour on both sides and shake off the excess. Dip in the beaten egg mixture, allowing the excess to drip into the dish. Gently add the cutlets to the oil and cook until golden brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes (there should be active, but not violent, bubbling at the edges of the cutlets). Carefully flip them and cook until the second side is golden brown, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer the cutlets to the prepared wire rack, and put in the oven to keep warm. Repeat to cook the remaining cutlets, adjusting the heat if necessary to avoid burning (do not discard the remaining flour).

Discard the oil in the skillet, then carefully wipe it out with paper towels. Set the skillet over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of the butter, and let melt, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan. Add the shallot, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the vermouth, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a strong simmer. Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to loosen and dissolve the caramelized bits, until the vermouth is reduced by almost half, about 2½ minutes. Add the chicken broth, lemon slices, and any juices accumulated from the rested cutlets. Return the mixture to a strong simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until again reduced by about almost half, about 3 minutes longer.

Meanwhile, cut the remaining 2 tablespoons butter into small cubes, add to the flour, and toss to coat. Remove the skillet from the heat, add the coated butter and ¼ teaspoon salt, season with pepper, and whisk to melt and incorporate the butter. Add the parsley and whisk to incorporate. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Arrange the cutlets on a serving platter and spoon the sauce and lemon slices over them before serving.
