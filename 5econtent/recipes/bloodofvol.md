## Blood of Vol

**Serves** 4

7 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

4 ounces thinly sliced salami or other cured sausage, cut into thin strips

1 large yellow onion, chopped

5 large red bell peppers, cored, seeded, and thinly sliced

1 bay leaf

Kosher salt

4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced

1½ teaspoons paprika

1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme

½ teaspoon red pepper flakes

One 14½-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes, drained and crushed by hand into small pieces, with ¼ cup juices reserved

1 teaspoon sherry vinegar

⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley

Freshly ground black pepper

8 eggs

Line a plate with paper towels.

In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm 3 tablespoons of the olive oil until shimmering. Add the salami and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, about 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the salami to the prepared plate and set aside, leaving the oil in the skillet. Add the onion, bell peppers, bay leaf, and 1 teaspoon salt to the skillet. Adjust the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring frequently, until the bell peppers are tender-crisp, about 20 minutes. Clear the center of the skillet, add 1½ tablespoons olive oil, and let warm for a moment. Add the garlic, paprika, thyme, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring just those aromatics, until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Add the cooked salami and tomatoes with the reserved juices and stir to incorporate along with the aromatics into the bell peppers. Adjust the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the flavors meld, about 5 minutes longer.

Remove the bay leaf; add the vinegar, most of the parsley, and ½ teaspoon salt; season with pepper; and stir to blend. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Transfer the mixture to a serving dish and set aside. Wipe out the skillet with paper towels.

In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, 1½ tablespoons olive oil, ¾ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper and whisk until uniformly yellow.

Adjust the heat to medium, add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet, and warm until shimmering. Add the egg mixture and cook, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Using a flexible heatproof spatula, scramble the eggs by scraping along the bottom and sides of the skillet and folding them in large strokes until clumped in large curds and just slightly wet, about 2 minutes longer. Immediately scrape the eggs over the pepper mixture in the serving dish. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley before serving.
