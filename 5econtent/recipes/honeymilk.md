## Honey Milk

**Makes** 4 cups

4 cups whole milk

1½ tablespoons honey

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the milk and honey and bring to a bare simmer, stirring to dissolve the honey. Remove from the heat and let the mixture cool until barely warm. Pour it into a container with a tight-fitting lid and seal. Refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours, before serving.
