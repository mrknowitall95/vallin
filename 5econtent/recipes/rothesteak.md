## Rothé Steak

**Serves** 4

Two 1-pound boneless strip steaks (see Cook's Note), 1½ to 2 inches thick

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon neutral oil

3 tablespoons unsalted butter

2 garlic cloves, crushed and peeled

8 large sprigs fresh thyme or rosemary

Cast iron is the skillet of choice here because it retains heat so well.

This cooking technique is a bit messy—the fat splatters in the intense heat, and a splatter screen is of no help because of the frequent turning. The entire process moves fast, so turn on your exhaust fan and have your tongs, basting spoon, and thermometer at hand before you start cooking. And, of course, use oven mitts when handling the screaming-hot skillet.

Depending on where you live, strip steak may be called shell steak, sirloin strip steak, New York strip steak, Kansas City strip steak, or Texas strip steak, among other names. Whatever name it goes by, make sure it's thick.

A large-flake, crunchy salt, like Maldon, is a terrific finish at serving time.

Using paper towels, pat the steaks dry and season generously with salt and pepper on both sides and along the edges. Place the steaks on a plate and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour. (Or refrigerate, loosely covered, for up to 2 days. Return the steaks to room temperature before cooking.)

Set a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 7 minutes (the pan may smoke a bit). Adjust the heat to high, add the neutral oil, and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan (the oil will smoke too). Add the steaks and cook, flipping them every 30 seconds, until a pale golden crust begins to form on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes.

Adjust the heat to medium-high, slide the steaks to one side of the skillet, add the butter to the other side, and allow it to melt and foam slightly. Add the garlic and thyme to the butter. Tilt the pan toward the butter so that it pools opposite the steaks and, while continuing to flip the steaks every 30 seconds, use a long-handled, large metal spoon to baste them with the butter and aromatics, concentrating on spots that are lighter and less crusted. (If the butter smokes or the steaks begin to burn, lower the heat slightly.) Cook, basting and flipping the steaks, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest spot registers 120° to 125°F for medium-rare, about 7 minutes longer, or about 130°F for medium, 8 to 9 minutes longer.

Transfer the steaks to a carving board, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice the steaks against the grain into roughly ½-inch-thick slices before serving.
