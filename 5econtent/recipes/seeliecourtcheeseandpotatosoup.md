## Seelie Court Cheese and Potato Soup

**Makes** about 2½ quarts

3 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 large yellow onion, chopped

1 large celery rib, trimmed and chopped

2 bay leaves

Kosher salt

1½ tablespoons pressed or grated garlic

2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme

6 cups low-sodium chicken broth

1½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled and chopped

One 5.2-ounce package Boursin cheese flavored with garlic and fine herbs, crumbled and at room temperature, plus more cheese for garnish (optional)

¾ cup half-and-half

Freshly ground black pepper

¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

¼ cup snipped fresh chives

In a large saucepan or medium pot over medium-high heat, melt the butter, swirling to coat the pan. Add the onion, celery, bay leaves, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring until the vegetables are heated through, about 3 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium-low, cover, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have released their juices, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the chicken broth and potatoes, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Adjust the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are very tender, about 25 minutes. Remove and discard the bay leaves. Add the cheese, cover, and heat until the cheese softens or melts, about 2 minutes.

Remove the soup from the heat. Using an immersion blender, blend until smooth. Alternatively, let the soup cool slightly and blend in batches in a countertop blender. Return the soup to the saucepan, if necessary.

Adjust the heat to medium-low, add the half-and-half and 1 teaspoon salt, season with pepper, and warm the soup, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 4 minutes. Add the parsley and about half the chives and stir to combine. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Ladle into individual bowls and sprinkle with additional Boursin (if desired), and the remaining chives before serving.
