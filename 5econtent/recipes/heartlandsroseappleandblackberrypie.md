## Heartlands Rose Apple and Blackberry Pie

**Makes** one 9-inch deep-dish pie

⅔ cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar

½ teaspoon ground cinnamon

3 tablespoons cornstarch

Kosher salt

3½ pounds (about 6) baking apples (such as Golden Delicious, Ginger Gold, Jonathan, Jonagold, Honeycrisp, Cortland, or Empire), peeled, quartered, cored, and cut lengthwise into ¼-inch slices

Pastry for 2 double-crust pies, thawed if frozen and rested at room temperature until pliable without cracking, about 30 minutes

12 ounces (about 2½ cups) blackberries, rinsed

1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

1½ tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces

1 egg

Lightly sweetened whipped cream for serving (optional)

n a large microwave-safe bowl, mix ⅓ cup of the sugar, the cinnamon, 1 tablespoon of the cornstarch, and ¼ teaspoon salt. Add the apples and toss gently to combine. Microwave the mixture until the apples just begin to soften and release juices, 7 to 10 minutes, stirring gently with a flexible spatula every 2 to 3 minutes. Cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

On a floured work surface or sheet of parchment paper, roll out one piece of pastry into a 12-inch circle. Transfer the pastry into a deep-dish pie plate, fitting it in by gently lifting the edge of the pastry with one hand while lightly pressing it into the plate bottom and up the sides with the other hand; leave an overhang of about 1 inch. Refrigerate until the pastry is firm, about 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 425°F with a large baking sheet on a rack in the lower-middle position in the oven.

In a bowl, mix together ⅓ cup of the sugar, the remaining 2 tablespoons cornstarch, and a tiny pinch of salt. Add the blackberries and gently toss to coat. Add the lemon juice and gently fold until the sugar mixture is moistened and syrupy. Spread the blackberry mixture evenly into the dough-lined pie plate and scatter the butter pieces over the berry mixture. With a slotted spoon, spoon the apples evenly over the berries and mound them slightly in the center. Pour about half of the exuded juices over the apples.

On a floured work surface or sheet of parchment paper, roll out the second piece of pastry into a 12-inch circle. Place the pastry over the apples, leaving an overhang of about 1 inch. Using kitchen shears, cut evenly through both layers of overhanging pastry, leaving an overhang of about ½ inch. Fold the pastry under itself so that the edge of the fold is even with the edge of the pie plate and flute the pastry using your thumb and forefinger, or crimp it with the tines of a fork, to seal.

In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush onto the top of the pie (you'll probably have some left over). Sprinkle the remaining 1 tablespoon sugar evenly over the top. Set the pie on the preheated baking sheet and bake until the top is light golden brown, about 25 minutes. Adjust the temperature to 375°F, rotate the baking sheet 180 degrees, and continue baking until the crust is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes more.

Set the pie on a wire rack and let it cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Serve with whipped cream, if desired.
