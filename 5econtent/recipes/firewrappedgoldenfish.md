## Fire-Wrapped Golden Fish

**Serves** 4

6 cups canola oil or corn oil

Kosher salt

2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper

1½ teaspoons cayenne pepper

Ice cubes

About 1½ cups cold tap water

1 cup all-purpose flour

1½ tablespoons chili powder

2 teaspoons garlic powder

1½ pounds firm, meaty white-fleshed fish fillets (such as halibut, tilapia, or mahi-mahi), skinned and cut into 3 by 1-inch strips

¾ cup plus 1 tablespoon cold sparkling water

Lime wedges for serving

Preheat the oven to 200°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels and set aside. Place a wire rack on another large rimmed baking sheet and set aside.

Clip a deep-fry or candy thermometer to the side of a medium Dutch oven over medium-high heat and warm the canola oil to 360°F. In a small bowl, combine 2 teaspoons salt, the black pepper, and ¾ teaspoon of the cayenne and stir to mix.

While the oil heats, fill a large bowl one-third of the way with ice and add the tap water. In a medium bowl (preferably stainless steel), combine the flour, chili powder, garlic powder, remaining ¾ teaspoon cayenne, and ¾ teaspoon salt and whisk to incorporate. Set this bowl in the bowl of ice water to chill the flour mixture.

Spread the fish on a platter or a third rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle the fish all over with the seasoning mixture and set aside.

When the oil is at temperature, add the sparkling water to the flour mixture and stir just until the wet and dry ingredients are mixed but still a little lumpy (do not overmix).

Add six pieces of fish to the batter and coat them thoroughly. Using tongs or chopsticks, remove three pieces, allowing excess batter to drip back into the bowl, and slip the fish into the oil. Wait 30 seconds and repeat with the other three battered pieces. Fry until slightly puffed and golden brown, turning the pieces once or twice to promote even frying and prevent them from sticking to each other, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain 360°F, 4 to 5 minutes. Using a spider skimmer, slotted spoon, or long tongs, transfer the fried fish to the paper towel–lined baking sheet to drain for about 30 seconds. Sprinkle the fried fish lightly with salt, transfer to the prepared wire rack set, and place in the oven to keep warm. Allow the oil to return to 360°F and repeat until all the fish are cooked. Serve immediately with lime wedges.
