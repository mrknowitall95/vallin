## Silverfruit Pie

**Serves** 8

2 teaspoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus 5 tablespoons melted and still warm

14 whole graham crackers, broken into rough pieces

3 tablespoons light brown sugar

Kosher salt

One 20-ounce can lychees (peeled, pitted, and in heavy syrup)

12 ounces mascarpone, at cool room temperature

3 tablespoons confectioners' sugar

2 teaspoons rosewater

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 tablespoons apple jelly

1½ teaspoons finely grated lemon zest

Rather than warming the apple jelly on the stovetop, you can warm it in a microwave-safe container in the microwave, using partial power, for about 30 seconds, stopping to check and stir it about every 10 seconds.

Even though you drain and dry the lychees, they'll retain enough moisture to weep on the pie if they sit for too long. It's best to serve the pie no more than an hour after glazing it. If you have leftovers, refrigerate them and expect the jam to slide off the lychees and pool between them and at the edges of the crust. If you'd like, use a small bit of paper towel to blot away visible liquid before serving.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 350°F. Coat a 9-inch pie plate with the room-temperature butter, and set aside.

In a food processor, process the graham crackers to fine crumbs, about 20 seconds. Add the brown sugar and 1 pinch salt and pulse to combine. With the motor running, slowly add the melted butter through the feed tube and process until the mixture resembles wet sand, about 20 seconds. Pour the mixture into the pie plate and press into an even, compact layer across the bottom and up the sides. Wipe out the food processor work bowl to use again.

Bake the crust until lightly browned and fragrant, about 12 minutes, rotating the pie plate about halfway through. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature (the crust will firm up as it cools).

Meanwhile, drain the lychees well and blot them dry with paper towel. Line a plate or baking sheet with paper towels in a double layer. Cut each lychee in half, place them cut sides down on the paper towel-lined plate, and refrigerate until needed, at least 1 hour.

Add the mascarpone, confectioners' sugar, rosewater, vanilla, and ¼ teaspoon salt to the food processor and pulse until combined and smooth, stopping once or twice to scrape down the work bowl, about 10 two-second pulses. Scrape the mixture into the crust, gently spread it in an even layer, and refrigerate until firmer, at least 1 hour. Arrange the lychees, cut-sides down, over the mascarpone, covering the entire surface, and gently press them into the mixture to anchor.

In a small saucepan over medium heat, warm the apple jelly until warm to the touch and beginning to become fluid, stirring to smooth out any lumps. Off heat, cool the fluid jelly for about 5 minutes. Stir it again and, using a pastry brush, gently dab and brush the jelly over the lychees. Refrigerate for 30 minutes, sprinkle the lemon zest over the pie, and serve immediately.
