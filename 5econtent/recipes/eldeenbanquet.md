## Eldeen Banquet

**Serves** 4

Kosher salt

2 pounds eggplant, peeled, stem ends trimmed, and cut lengthwise into ¾-inch-thick slices

½ cup all-purpose flour

Freshly ground black pepper

2 eggs

3½ cups panko breadcrumbs

1½ teaspoons crumbled dried oregano

1½ teaspoons paprika

1½ teaspoons garlic powder

1½ teaspoons onion powder

1 pinch cayenne pepper

½ cup olive oil (not extra-virgin)

#### Sautéed Tomatoes

1½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

¼ cup minced shallot

Kosher salt

2 teaspoons pressed or grated garlic

3 cups cherry tomatoes or large grape tomatoes, halved

1 pinch granulated sugar

½ teaspoon sherry or balsamic vinegar

2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

You'll need at least two, and preferably three, baking sheets. If you don't have a third, you can use a large cutting board for the dredged eggplant slices.

Line two baking sheets with clean kitchen towels or a triple layer of paper towels.

Sprinkle 1 tablespoon salt evenly over both sides of the eggplant slices to draw out its water and arrange the eggplant in a single layer on the prepared baking sheets. Allow to drain for about 1 hour, flipping the slices halfway through. Blot the eggplant dry with another clean kitchen towel or triple layer of paper towels, pressing firmly but taking care not to crush the eggplant. Transfer to a bowl or plate, and set aside. Wash and dry the baking sheets.

With racks in the upper- and lower-middle positions, place a baking sheet on each rack, and preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a large platter or third baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

In a shallow dish, such as a pie plate, combine the flour and 1 teaspoon pepper and whisk to incorporate. In a second shallow dish, beat the eggs until uniform. In a third shallow dish, combine the panko, oregano, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne, ½ teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and stir to blend.

Working with one or two eggplant slices at a time, dredge them in the flour and tap off any excess. Dip the floured slices into the egg to coat thoroughly, allowing any excess to drip into the dish. Then dredge in the panko mixture to coat thoroughly, pressing the panko onto the eggplant to help adhere. Place the slices on the prepared platter, and repeat with the remaining eggplant slices, trying not to overlap them.

Carefully remove the preheated baking sheets from the oven. Add ¼ cup of the olive oil to each sheet and, using a heatproof silicone brush, spread it out evenly. Place half the breaded eggplant slices on each baking sheet in a single layer. Bake for 20 minutes and then flip the slices, rotating the baking sheets, and swap between the racks. Continue baking until the eggplant is well browned and crisp, 20 to 25 minutes longer.

***To make the tomatoes:.*** About 10 minutes after flipping the eggplant slices, in a medium skillet over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the shallot and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring constantly, until the shallot starts to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the tomatoes, shake the pan to coat them with oil, and cook, shaking the skillet occasionally, until they soften but do not collapse completely, about 4 minutes, adding the sugar halfway through cooking. Add the vinegar and parsley and toss to distribute. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt if necessary.

Sprinkle the baked eggplant very lightly with salt. Transfer to a serving platter, spoon the tomatoes over or around the eggplant, and sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately.
