## Plate-of-Gold

**Serves** 4 as an appetizer

#### Sweet and Sour Sauce

⅓ cup apricot or peach jam or orange marmalade

⅓ cup ketchup

3 tablespoons cider vinegar

1 tablespoon light or dark brown sugar

2 teaspoons soy sauce

½ teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (optional)

Kosher salt

#### Tempura

About 1½ quarts canola or other high-smoke-point oil for frying

⅔ cup cake flour

3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Kosher salt

⅔ cup plus 1 tablespoon sparkling water, cold

8 ounces fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed, very large caps halved, cold

1 sweet potato, peeled, halved lengthwise, and cut crosswise into ¼-inch slices, cold

1 yellow onion, trimmed, halved pole to pole, and cut lengthwise into ½-inch slivers, cold

MAKE THE SAUCE. In a small saucepan over medium heat, warm the jam, stirring, until mostly fluid, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, chile-garlic sauce (if using), and ½ teaspoon salt and whisk to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook, whisking, to blend the flavors, about 1 minute. Set aside to cool to room temperature. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, if necessary.

MAKE THE TEMPURA. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels and set aside. Clip a deep-fry or candy thermometer to the side of a heavy 5-quart Dutch oven, add the oil, and warm over medium-high heat to 390°F. Preheat the oven to 200°F. Place a wire rack on a second large, rimmed baking sheet and set aside.

Meanwhile, fill a large bowl about one-third full with ice and about 1½ cups water. In a medium (preferably stainless-steel) bowl that will fit in the larger bowl, whisk together the cake and all-purpose flours and ¾ teaspoon salt; set this bowl in the bowl with the ice water to chill the flour mixture. When the oil reaches 390°F, add the sparkling water to the flour mixture and stir just until the wet and dry are incorporated, but still a little lumpy; do not overmix.

Working with about eight pieces at a time, use tongs or chopsticks to dip them in the batter to coat thoroughly. Allow any excess batter to drip off, then slip them into the oil and fry until slightly puffed and pale gold, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain 390°F, stirring to prevent sticking, and turning the pieces over in the oil once or twice to promote even frying, 5 to 6 minutes for each batch. With a spider skimmer, slotted spoon, or long tongs, transfer the tempura to the paper towel–lined baking sheet to drain for about 30 seconds. Sprinkle lightly with salt and place on the wire rack set on the baking sheet and put in the oven to keep warm. Allow the oil to recover to 390°F and fry the remaining batches. Serve with the sweet and sour sauce.
