## Surrogate Steaks

**Serves** 4

1½ pounds plant-based ground meat, such as Impossible Burger

1 tablespoon soy sauce

2 teaspoons garlic powder

1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme

Kosher salt

2½ tablespoons freshly and very coarsely ground black pepper

1 tablespoon neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

1 shallot, finely chopped

2 garlic cloves, finely chopped

½ cup brandy or cognac, plus 1 tablespoon

1 cup low-sodium vegetable broth

⅓ cup heavy cream

½ teaspoon light brown sugar

2 teaspoons grainy mustard (optional)

½ teaspoon fresh lemon juice

1½ tablespoons snipped fresh chives

Preheat the oven to 200°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.

In a large bowl, break up the meat into coarse chunks. Add the soy sauce, garlic powder, 1½ teaspoons of the thyme, and ¾ teaspoon salt. Mix to distribute the seasonings fully, but do not overmix. Shape the mixture into two "steaks," about 5 inches in diameter and 1¼ inches thick.

Spread the pepper in a wide, shallow dish, such as a pie plate. Dredge one side of each steak in the pepper, pressing lightly to make it adhere.

In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, warm 1½ teaspoons of the oil until shimmering. Add the steaks, unpeppered-side down, and cook undisturbed until well-browned on the bottom, about 4 minutes; if the skillet becomes too smoky at any point, adjust the heat accordingly. Adjust the heat to medium, turn the steaks peppered-side down, and cook undisturbed for 2 minutes more. Transfer the steaks to an ovenproof plate, tent loosely with foil, and place it in the oven to stay warm. Pour off any fat accumulated in the skillet and wipe it out.

Add the remaining 1½ teaspoons oil to the skillet over medium heat, and warm until shimmering. Add the shallot, remaining 1½ teaspoons thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring, until the shallot is barely softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add the ½ cup brandy and cook until reduced slightly, about 1 minute more. Add the broth, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced by almost half, about 5 minutes. Add the cream and sugar and cook, stirring, until the liquid is reduced slightly and coats the back of a spoon, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat; add the mustard (if using), 1 tablespoon brandy, lemon juice, and 1 tablespoon of the chives; and stir to incorporate. Taste and adjust with salt, if necessary. Spoon the sauce over and around the steaks and sprinkle with the remaining chives. Serve at once.
