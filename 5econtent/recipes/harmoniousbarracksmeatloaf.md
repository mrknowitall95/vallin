## Harmonious Barracks Meatloaf

**Serves** 6 to 8

2 cups lightly packed, torn crustless pieces French, Italian, or other sturdy white bread (1-inch pieces)

⅔ cup whole or 2% milk

2 eggs, beaten

1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped

Kosher salt

2 tablespoons pressed or grated garlic

2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary

1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme

1½ pounds ground lamb

½ pound ground chuck (preferably 85% lean)

1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

½ cup finely chopped fresh parsley

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Line a large wire rack with foil and poke holes in the foil. Set the rack on the baking sheet and set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the bread and milk and let soak, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 15 minutes. With a potato masher or fork, mash the mixture to a loose paste. Add the eggs and stir vigorously to combine.

In a medium skillet over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onion and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic, rosemary, and thyme and continue to cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Scrape into a bowl and let cool to room temperature.

Add the lamb, chuck, onion mixture, 2 teaspoons salt, and the pepper to the bread mixture. Set aside 1 tablespoon of the parsley, and add the remaining 7 tablespoons to the bowl. Fold and stir the mixture gently until well blended. On the prepared rack, form the mixture into a roughly 9 by 5-inch loaf.

Bake the meatloaf until an instant-read thermometer inserted near the center registers 155° to 160°F, about 1¼ hours. Let the meatloaf cool for about 10 minutes, then transfer to a cutting board or serving plate. Slice it with a serrated blade and serve.
