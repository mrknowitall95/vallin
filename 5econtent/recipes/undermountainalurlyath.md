## Undermountain Alurlyath

**Serves** 2

One 1-pound English or standard cucumber, scrubbed but not peeled

2 ounces Amontillado sherry

1 ounce honey syrup

1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

Small ice cubes

6 ounces plain seltzer, cold

Stirring in the cucumber juice, rather than shaking it with the other ingredients, prevents it from becoming too frothy.

Cut the cucumber in half crosswise, then cut two thin slices from the cut side of one half and reserve them for garnish. Chop the rest of the cucumber halves and transfer to a food processor. Process into a liquidy pulp, about 10 seconds, stopping once to scrape down the sides of the work bowl.

Line a medium bowl with a clean kitchen towel. Scrape the cucumber pulp into the center, gather the edges and corners of the towel, and, working over the bowl, squeeze and twist hard to wring out as much liquid as possible. Compost the pulp or reserve for another use.

Fill a cocktail shaker with the sherry, honey syrup, and lemon juice. Cover and shake to blend, about 10 seconds. Remove the cover, add 1 cup of the cucumber juice, and stir to combine.

Fill two rocks or wine glasses about halfway with ice, add half the sherry-cucumber mixture to each, top each with 3 ounces seltzer, and stir gently. Garnish each drink with a reserved cucumber slice before serving.
