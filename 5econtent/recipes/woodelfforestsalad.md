## Wood Elf Forest Salad

**Serves** 4 to 6

1 orange

1 lemon

1 tablespoon cider vinegar

1 tablespoon honey

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 small shallot, finely chopped

¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil

1 pound brussels sprouts, trimmed, halved, and very thinly sliced

½ small head radicchio, thinly sliced; long strands cut in half, if necessary

1 bundle fresh chives, chopped (about ¾ cup), or fresh dill

Edible flowers, such as nasturtiums or pansies, for sprinkling (optional)

Finely grate 1 teaspoon of zest from both the orange and the lemon. Transfer the zest to a large salad bowl. Squeeze 2 teaspoons of juice from the lemon and add it to the bowl along with the vinegar, honey, ½ teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste and whisk to combine. Add the shallot and set aside for the flavors to blend, about 10 minutes.

While whisking vigorously, add the olive oil to the bowl in a slow, steady stream to combine and emulsify the dressing. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Add the brussels sprouts, toss to coat with the dressing, and set aside for them to begin to soften, about 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, peel the orange, trim away any residual bits of pith, thinly slice the fruit, and cut the slices into quarters.

Add the radicchio and the chives to the sprouts, toss to combine. Add the orange pieces and toss lightly to distribute. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Sprinkle the edible flowers (if using) over the salad and serve.
