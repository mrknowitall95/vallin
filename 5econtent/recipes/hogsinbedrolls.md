## Hogs in Bedrolls

**Makes** about 40 rolls

1 to 2 sheet(s) frozen all-butter puff pastry (see Cook's Note), thawed according to package directions

1 (12-ounce) package cocktail franks

1 egg

Ketchup, mustard, barbecue sauce, or steak sauce for dipping (optional)

The measurements of different brands of puff pastry sheets differ, but most include two sheets.

Many cocktail franks measure about 1½ inches in length. If yours differ, adjust the size of your puff pastry squares accordingly, keeping them about ½ inch longer and wider than the franks. If you can't find cocktail franks, buy the most slender hot dogs you can and cut them into 1½-inch lengths. If the hot dogs are fatter than cocktail franks, though, you may have to adjust the size of your puff squares.

Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick (silicone) liners.

On a lightly floured work surface, unfold or unroll the puff pastry. If necessary, use a rolling pin to gently roll it flat (take care not to press too hard, which compresses the layers, decreasing its puff when baked). Cut as many 2-inch squares as you have cocktail franks. Lay each frank diagonally on a square, fold the two opposite corners up and over the frank to meet at the top, and press or pinch them to adhere. Arrange them about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets.

In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush the top and sides of each bedroll with the mixture. Bake until the bedrolls are browned, puffed, and crisp, about 17 minutes, rotating the sheets 180 degrees and switching racks halfway through baking. Set the baking sheets on wire racks and let the bedrolls cool for about 5 minutes. Serve hot, with ketchup, mustard, barbecue sauce, or steak sauce on the side for dipping (if desired).
