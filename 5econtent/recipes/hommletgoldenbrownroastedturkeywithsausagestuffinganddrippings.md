## Hommlet Golden Brown Roasted Turkey with Sausage Stuffing and Drippings

**Serves** 4

#### Stuffing

¾ pound hearty white sandwich bread (8 to 10 slices), cut into ½-inch cubes (about 8 cups, lightly packed)

4 tablespoons unsalted butter

2 teaspoons neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

12 ounces fresh sweet Italian pork sausage, casings removed, if necessary

1 yellow onion, chopped

2 celery stalks, trimmed and chopped

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme

1½ teaspoons minced fresh rosemary

1½ cups low-sodium chicken broth

2 eggs

½ cup chopped fresh parsley

#### Turkey

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 carrot, peeled and coarsely chopped

1 celery stalk, trimmed and coarsely chopped

1 small yellow onion, coarsely chopped

4 large, bone-in, skin-on turkey drumsticks (about 1 pound each)

3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled

#### Gravy

2¼ cups low-sodium chicken broth, plus more as needed

6 slices thick-cut bacon

1 carrot, peeled and finely chopped

1 celery stalk, trimmed and finely chopped

1 yellow onion, finely chopped

1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme

3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

¼ cup finely chopped fresh parsley

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

***Make the Stuffing.*** Preheat the oven to 250°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Spread the bread cubes in an even layer on a large rimmed baking sheet and bake until dry and firm, about 45 minutes, stirring them several times. Transfer the bread cubes into a very large bowl and set aside.

***Meanwhile, Prepare the Turkey.*** Increase oven temperature to 400°F. In a small bowl, mix together 1½ tablespoons salt and 2 teaspoons pepper. Scatter the carrot, celery, and onion in a roasting pan or other stovetop-safe pan into which the drumsticks will fit.

Using your fingers, loosen but do not detach the skin from the drumsticks. Brush about half the melted butter under the skin, sprinkle each with some of the salt and pepper mix, and reposition the skin. Brush the drumsticks' skin with the remaining butter and sprinkle each with some of the remaining salt and pepper mix. Arrange the drumsticks over the vegetables in the pan.

Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each drumstick registers 180° to 185°F, 1 to 1¼ hours. Transfer the drumsticks to a platter, cover loosely with foil, and set aside.

***While the Turkey Roasts, Finish Preparing the Stuffing.*** Grease a broiler-safe 8-inch square (or similarly sized) baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the butter and set aside.

In a skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil until shimmering. Add the sausage and cook, stirring and breaking up clumps into small crumbles, until some of the fat has rendered and the sausage is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to paper towels to drain, leaving the fat in the skillet.

Add the remaining 3 tablespoons butter to the skillet and melt. Add the onion, celery, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until very soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the thyme and rosemary and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add ¾ cup of the broth and stir and scrape the bottom of the skillet to loosen any brown bits. Add this mixture, the sausage, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste to the bowl of bread and toss well to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

In a small bowl, whisk the remaining ¾ cup broth and the eggs until well combined. Add the egg mixture and most of the parsley to the bowl of bread mixture and toss to combine well. Pour the stuffing into the prepared baking dish, spread it into an even layer, cover the dish tightly with foil, and place it on a baking sheet. Put in the oven with the turkey and bake until the stuffing is heated through and the moisture from the mixture is bubbling around the edges of the dish, about 50 minutes.

***Once the Turkey Is Done Roasting, Make the Gravy.*** Use a slotted spoon or skimmer to hold back the solids in the roasting pan and pour the accumulated liquid into a fat separator or measuring cup. Let rest until all the fat rises to the surface, about 10 minutes. If you are using a fat separator, pour the drippings into another container and reserve the fat; if you are using a measuring cup, tilt it and use a wide, shallow soup spoon to skim the fat off the surface and deposit into another container. Reserve the remaining juices.

Set a strainer over a bowl. Place the roasting pan with the roasted vegetables over medium heat and cook undisturbed, until the vegetables begin to brown and stick to the pan, 3 to 4 minutes. Add 1 cup of the chicken broth and, using a wooden spoon, stir and scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen and dissolve the browned bits. Strain the liquid and discard the solids. Add the reserved juices liquid and enough chicken broth to equal 3 cups and set aside.

Wipe out the pan, set it over medium-low heat, and fry the bacon, turning it over as necessary, until well-rendered and lightly browned, about 13 minutes. Transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain, chop it, and reserve. You should have about 3 tablespoons of fat left in the pan.

Set the pan over medium heat and warm until the fat is shimmering. Add the carrot, celery, onion, and thyme and cook, stirring, until the vegetables soften, about 4 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until dark golden and fragrant with a nutty aroma, 3 to 4 minutes. Switch to a whisk and, whisking constantly, gradually add the strained broth mixture. Continuing to whisk, cook until the gravy thickens, about 8 minutes. Add the lemon juice, parsley, bacon, and pepper to taste and whisk to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary.

Once the stuffing is done, if you wish to crisp the skin on the underside of the drumsticks, preheat the broiler. Line a broiler-safe pan or rimmed baking sheet with foil, arrange the drumsticks with the browned sides down, and broil until the skin is browned and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes.

Remove the foil from the stuffing and fluff with a fork. If you'd like to crisp the surface of the stuffing, return the dish to the oven, and broil, checking frequently to prevent burning, until the surface is a shade darker and starting to crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle the stuffing with the remaining parsley. Serve the drumsticks piping hot alongside the stuffing and gravy
