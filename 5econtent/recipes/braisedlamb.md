## Braised Lamb

**Serves** 4 to 6

1½ tablespoons olive oil

15 garlic cloves, finely chopped

1½ tablespoons finely chopped fresh thyme

1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary

3½ pounds butterflied boneless leg of lamb, untied and netting discarded, if necessary

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 teaspoons neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

½ cup dry vermouth

1½ pounds (about 5 cups) frozen pearl onions, thawed, drained, and blotted dry

2 teaspoons light brown sugar

3 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

¼ cup chopped fresh mint

A boneless leg of lamb can take up to 30 minutes to trim. Because the leg includes muscles of varying thickness, use a sharp boning knife to cut slits in the meat and then pound the whole leg to even the thickness before rolling and tying it.

In a small nonstick skillet over medium heat, mix the olive oil, garlic, thyme, and rosemary and cook, stirring, until it just begins to sizzle, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape the mixture into a small bowl (you should have about ⅓ cup); remove 1½ tablespoons of the mixture and reserve separately.

With a sharp, thin-bladed (boning) knife, trim the fat, gristle, and silverskin from both the exterior and interior of the lamb. With the tip of the knife, make cuts in the larger muscles to help them flatten; cover the meat with plastic wrap and pound it to as even a thickness as possible. With the tip of the knife, lightly score the interior side of the meat with ¼-inch-deep cuts about 1 inch apart in a crosshatch pattern. Rub the greater quantity of the garlic-herb mixture over the scored surface, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges; sprinkle evenly with 1½ teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Roll the meat into a neat, compact cylinder, tucking in any loose bits and flaps as you go, and tie with kitchen twine at 1½-inch intervals, as well as once or twice lengthwise. Set the lamb aside at room temperature to rest for 1 hour.

Preheat the oven to 400°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Dry the lamb with paper towels and generously sprinkle it all over with salt and pepper.

In a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, warm the oil until shimmering. Add the lamb and brown well on all sides, turning it once every 3 minutes, for about 12 minutes. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast until the center of the meat registers 120° to 125°F for medium-rare (or 130° to 135°F for medium to medium-well) on an instant-read thermometer, about 40 minutes.

Transfer the lamb to a carving board, cover loosely with foil, and let rest for about 15 minutes (the internal temperature will increase while the meat rests).

Meanwhile, taking care with the screaming-hot skillet, set it over medium-high heat. Add the vermouth and bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping the bottom of the skillet to loosen and dissolve any sticking bits. Add the pearl onions and ¾ teaspoon salt, return to a simmer, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add the brown sugar and reserved garlic-herb mixture, stir to incorporate, and continue simmering, uncovered, until the onions are fully tender and the liquid in the pan is reduced to about 1 tablespoon, about 4 minutes more.

Remove the skillet from the heat, add the butter, and stir to melt and incorporate it. Add the lemon juice and pepper to taste and stir to incorporate. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, if necessary. Add most of the mint and stir to distribute.

Remove the twine, slice the lamb, and arrange on a warmed serving platter. Transfer the mint mixture to the platter with the lamb or into its own serving bowl, sprinkle with the remaining mint, and serve at once.
