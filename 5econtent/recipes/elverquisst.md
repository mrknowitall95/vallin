**Makes** about 1¾ quarts

¼ cup granulated sugar

¼ cup warm water

One 750 ml bottle cold inexpensive, medium-bodied, dry red wine (such as Merlot)

1½ cups apple juice

1 cup pomegranate juice

½ cup Calvados or another brandy

3 cinnamon sticks

1 cup plain seltzer, cold

1 cup large ice cubes, plus more for serving

Apple slices for garnish (optional)

In a large bowl or pitcher, combine the sugar and water and stir to dissolve the sugar. Add the wine, both juices, Calvados, and cinnamon sticks and stir. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.

When ready to serve, remove the cinnamon sticks, if desired. Add the seltzer and ice cubes and stir to blend. Pour into ice-filled punch or juice glasses, and garnish each with an apple slice, if desired.
