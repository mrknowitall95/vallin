## Black Lotus Root

**Serves** 6 as a snack

12 ounces fresh lotus root, peeled and sliced ¼ inch thick

Kosher salt

⅔ cup unseasoned rice vinegar

⅔ cup water

3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon granulated sugar

1½ tablespoons butterfly pea powder (see Cook's Note)

1 medium shallot, very thinly sliced

Butterfly pea powder is made from the butterfly pea plant and is available online and at some natural food stores with a good selection of herbs and spices. In combination with an acidic ingredient, such as the rice vinegar, it produces a vivid purple tint.

In a large bowl, soak the sliced lotus in water to cover for about 15 minutes. Drain the lotus and set aside. Refill the bowl with ice water.

Meanwhile, fill a medium saucepan with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Add ½ teaspoon salt and the lotus, cover, and cook until just tender-crisp, about 1½ minutes (the water won't return to a full boil). Drain the lotus and immediately add to the ice water to stop the cooking. Drain again and set aside.

Set the saucepan over medium-high heat; add the vinegar, ⅔ cup water, and sugar; and bring to a bare simmer, whisking to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat, add the butterfly pea powder and ¼ teaspoon salt, and whisk to combine, taking care to break up any small clumps of powder. Add the blanched lotus and the shallot, submerging them in the liquid as much as possible, and set aside to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

Transfer the contents of the saucepan to a container, taking care to submerge the lotus as much as possible. Cover and refrigerate until the lotus is a deep shade of purple, at least 24 hours or up to 5 days. Serve cold.
