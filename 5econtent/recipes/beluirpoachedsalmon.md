## Beluir Poached Salmon

**Makes** about 2 cups

**Serves** 4 to 6

8 ounces salmon fillet, skin left on and any pinbones removed

8 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature

1½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more as needed

½ teaspoon paprika

1 pinch cayenne pepper

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

6 tablespoons minced shallots

3 ounces cold-smoked Nova Scotia-style salmon, finely chopped

¼ cup minced fresh chives

Crostini or thinly sliced baguette for serving

Capers for serving (see Cook's Note)

If you'd like to dampen the capers' saltiness, rinse them under cold running water and blot dry before serving.

The salmon can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days.

Fill a wide pot with about 3 inches of water, set a steamer basket into the pot (the water should not touch the steamer), cover, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the salmon fillet, skin-side down, cover, and steam until just slightly translucent at the center, 6 to 9 minutes, depending on its thickness (the salmon will finish cooking as it cools). Transfer the salmon to a plate and set aside to cool to room temperature. When ready to handle, remove and discard the skin and break the flesh into large flakes.

In a food processor, combine the cream cheese, lemon juice, paprika, cayenne, and ½ teaspoon salt and season with black pepper. Process until smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides of the work bowl, using a flexible spatula as necessary. Add about half the steamed salmon and process until well combined, again stopping to scrape down the sides of the work bowl as necessary. Scrape the mixture into a medium bowl, add the remaining steamed salmon, the shallots, smoked salmon, and chives. Using the spatula, fold the mixture until well combined. Adjust the seasoning with additional lemon juice, salt, and pepper, if necessary. Cover and refrigerate to let the flavors blend, about 30 minutes.

When ready to serve, let rest at room temperature for a few minutes so it loses its chill, then pass crostini and capers alongside.
