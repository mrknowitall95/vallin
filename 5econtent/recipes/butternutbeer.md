## Butternut Beer

**Serves** 2

Large ice cubes

3 ounces rye or bourbon

1½ ounces butterscotch schnapps

2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice

6 drops bitters (such as Angostura)

4 ounces plain seltzer, cold

8 ounces cream soda, cold

2 lemon slices

To frost the mugs, put in the freezer for an hour before using.

Fill two frosted mugs about halfway with ice. To each, add 1½ ounces rye, ¾ ounce schnapps, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, and 3 drops bitters and stir to blend and chill. Add 2 ounces seltzer and 4 ounces cream soda to each mug, and again stir gently to blend.

Garnish each drink with a lemon slice before serving.
