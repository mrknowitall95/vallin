## Meal's End

**Serves** 4

3 cups fresh strawberries, rinsed and hulled (or a mix of berries)

Sugar as needed

1⅓ cups heavy cream

⅓ cup plain Greek yogurt (preferably whole milk) or crème fraîche

¼ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

2 ounces packaged or homemade cocoa or vanilla meringues, coarsely crumbled (about 1⅓ cups)

Serve the Meal's End immediately after making it because time is unkind to the texture of the meringues.

If you feel that your berries require a flavor boost, add about 1 tablespoon of pomegranate juice or berry liqueur, orange liqueur, port, or even cognac.

You can substitute blueberries, blackberries, or peeled and cubed persimmons for the 1 cup sliced or quartered strawberries.

Coarsely chop 2 cups of the strawberries. In a bowl, mix the chopped strawberries with sugar to taste. Slice or quarter the remaining 1 cup berries. In a small bowl, mix these strawberries with sugar to taste.

With a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, a handheld electric mixer, or a whisk, beat the cream until it is softly whipped, adding 1 tablespoon sugar once the cream has thickened. This will take 1 to 1½ minutes with a stand mixer on high speed. Fold in the yogurt and vanilla just until blended. Fold in the chopped berries and crumbled meringues.

Divide the mixture among four serving dishes, top with the sliced berries, and serve at once.
