## Otik's Skillet-Fried Spiced Potatoes

**Serves** 4

2 tablespoons neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

1 large yellow onion, chopped

Kosher salt

1½ pounds (about 4) Yukon gold potatoes, scrubbed (or peeled if desired), quartered lengthwise, and cut into ¾-inch pieces

1 tablespoon salted butter

Freshly ground black pepper

1 teaspoon sweet paprika

1 teaspoon cayenne

½ teaspoon garlic powder

2 tablespoons minced fresh chives

In a 12- to 14-inch skillet over medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil until shimmering. Add the onion and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium and continue cooking, stirring often, until deep golden and some pieces are starting to brown at the edges, 4 to 6 minutes more. Scrape the onion onto a plate and wipe out the skillet.

Meanwhile, put the potatoes in a large microwave-safe bowl, cover, and microwave until the edges of the potatoes begin to soften, 5 to 7 minutes, shaking the bowl to redistribute the potatoes midway through.

Warm the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and the butter in the now-empty skillet over medium-high heat, swirling the pan to combine them. Add the potatoes (leaving behind any liquid accumulated in the bowl) and shake the skillet to coat the potatoes with the fat and evenly distribute them in a single layer, making sure that one side of each piece lies flat on the cooking surface. Cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on the bottom, 6 to 7 minutes. Using a wide spatula, carefully turn the potatoes, taking care not to rip their crusts, and again spread them into a single layer with unbrowned sides lying flat on the cooking surface, and continue cooking, undisturbed, until golden brown on the bottom, about 6 minutes more. Turn the potatoes again and repeat the process until they are tender and well-browned all over, turning one or two more times and adjusting the heat, if necessary, 6 to 12 minutes more. Add ½ teaspoon salt, pepper to taste, the paprika, cayenne, and garlic powder and stir or toss to distribute the seasonings. Add the onion and stir or toss to distribute. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve hot, sprinkling each serving with the chives.
