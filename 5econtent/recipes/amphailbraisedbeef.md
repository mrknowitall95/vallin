## Amphail Braised Beef

**Serves** 4

3 pounds beef chuck roast, trimmed of excess fat

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 tablespoons neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

5 yellow onions, thickly sliced

1 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed

2 teaspoons ground ginger

1½ tablespoons all-purpose flour

1 cup sparkling hard cider, preferably pear

½ cup low-sodium chicken broth

3 ripe-but-firm Bosc, Bartlett, or Anjou pears, peeled, cored, and cut into 1-inch pieces

¾ teaspoon cider vinegar

¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

Set the beef on a cutting board, dry it with paper towels, tie it into a uniform shape with kitchen twine at 2-inch intervals, and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.

In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the oil until shimmering. Add the beef and cook, undisturbed, until deeply browned on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the beef and continue cooking, until well browned on each of the remaining three sides, 10 to 12 minutes more. Transfer the beef to a large bowl.

Return the pot to medium-high heat, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and warm until shimmering. Add the onions and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally, until the onions begin to soften and release some liquid, about 4 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium-low and continue cooking for 15 minutes, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally and adjusting the heat as necessary to make sure the onions are cooking gently, not scorching. Add the thyme, ginger, and flour and continue to cook, stirring, until the onions are sticky and golden, about 5 minutes more. Add the cider, broth, and ½ teaspoon salt. Stir and scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen and dissolve the browned bits.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 300°F with a rack in the lower-middle of the oven.

Nestle the beef into the onions (the onions and accumulated juices should come about three-fourths of the way up the sides of the meat). Cover the pot, transfer it to the oven, and cook for 1 hour 35 minutes. Add the pears, nestling them into the onions, return the pot to the oven, and continue to cook, covered, until the beef is extremely tender (a paring knife should slip easily into the meat) and it registers 200°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 2¼ hours more.

Transfer the beef to a cutting board and, using a large slotted spoon, spoon the onions and pears onto a serving platter; tent loosely with foil to keep warm. Pour the accumulated liquid into a measuring cup and let rest until all the fat rises to the surface, about 10 minutes. Tilt the measuring cup and use a wide, shallow soup spoon to skim the fat off the surface and discard it. Add the vinegar and most of the parsley to the defatted liquid and stir to combine. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary.

Remove the twine from the beef and cut it against the grain into ½-inch-thick slices (or pull it apart into pieces). Place the meat on the platter with the onions and pears, pour the seasoned juices over the meat, sprinkle with the remaining parsley, and serve.
