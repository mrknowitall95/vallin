## Fried Soy with Vegetables

**Serves** 4

One 14- to 20-ounce block firm or extra-firm tofu

3 tablespoons soy sauce

2½ tablespoons Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry

3 teaspoons toasted sesame oil

⅓ cup low-sodium chicken broth, vegetable broth, or water

1 teaspoon light brown sugar

1 teaspoon cornstarch

6 medium scallions, white parts minced and green parts cut into 1-inch lengths

1½ tablespoons minced or grated fresh ginger

1 tablespoon minced or grated garlic

¼ cup neutral oil

Three 3-ounce baby bok choy (about 5 inches long), trimmed at the base and quartered lengthwise

2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 2-inch matchsticks

1 large red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into ½-inch-wide strips

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Serve this with hot freshly cooked rice—brown or white.

Line a small baking sheet or cutting board with a clean kitchen towel or triple thickness of paper towels. Halve the tofu block lengthwise, cut each half into 1-inch-thick slices, and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Top the tofu with another clean kitchen towel or triple thickness of paper towels and a second baking sheet or small cutting board. Weight it down with a large skillet or pot (or something of similar weight) and set aside to drain for 20 minutes.

On a large shallow dish, arrange the pressed tofu slices in a single layer. In a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of the rice wine, and 1½ teaspoons of the sesame oil and whisk to incorporate. Pour over the tofu, turn the slices to coat (take care not to break them), and let marinate for 15 minutes, turning them again halfway through.

Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce, remaining 1½ tablespoons rice wine, remaining 1½ teaspoons sesame oil, the chicken broth, brown sugar, and cornstarch; whisk to blend; and set aside. In another small bowl, combine the scallion whites, ginger, garlic, and 2 teaspoons of the neutral oil; stir to incorporate; and set aside.

In a large nonstick skillet over high heat, warm 2 teaspoons neutral oil until shimmering. Tilt the skillet to coat the bottom, add the tofu in a single layer, and cook, undisturbed, until browned on the bottom, 2½ to 3½ minutes. Turn the slices and continue cooking until browned on the second side, 2½ to 3½ minutes longer. Transfer the tofu to a large bowl, cut the slices in half, if desired, and set aside.

Return the skillet to high heat, add 2 teaspoons neutral oil, and warm until shimmering. Tilt the skillet to coat the bottom, add the bok choy, cut-side down, sprinkle lightly with salt, and cook, undisturbed, until spotted with brown on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Turn the pieces so the second cut side is down and continue to cook, undisturbed, until that side is spotty brown and the bok choy is barely tender, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to the bowl with the tofu.

Return the skillet to high heat, add 2 teaspoons neutral oil, and warm until shimmering. Tilt the skillet to coat the bottom; add the carrots, bell pepper, and ¼ teaspoon salt; and cook, stirring occasionally, until barely tender, about 2 minutes.

Adjust the heat to medium, clear the center of the skillet, add the remaining 4 teaspoons neutral oil, and allow it to warm for a moment. Add the ginger-garlic mixture and cook, stirring and mashing the mixture, until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Whisk the soy sauce mixture to recombine, add to the skillet, and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce is thickened, about 45 seconds.

Add the tofu, bok choy, scallion greens, and ½ teaspoon salt to the skillet and season with pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until heated through and coated with sauce, about 1 minute. Divide among four plates and serve immediately.
