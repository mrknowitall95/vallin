## Corned Beef and Cabbage

**Serves** 4

4 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled

3 tablespoons store-bought mixed pickling spice

1 (3-pound) corned beef brisket, flat (or thin) cut, rinsed well and fat trimmed to about a ¼-inch-thick layer, if necessary

1 yellow onion, quartered

2 carrots, peeled and chopped

2 celery ribs, trimmed and chopped

2 cups low-sodium chicken broth

1½ pounds (about 16) small red-skinned or Yukon gold creamer potatoes, scrubbed

1 (2-pound) small head green cabbage, tough outer leaves removed, cut through the core into 6 wedges

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened and cut into small pieces

3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

White wine vinegar for serving (optional)

When shopping for corned beef (or brisket, from which corned beef is made), you'll commonly see two cuts—flat (sometimes called thin) and point. Flat-cut is more uniformly shaped and thus will cook more evenly.

Preheat the oven to 300°F with a rack in the middle position of the oven.

In a large Dutch oven, combine the garlic, pickling spice, corned beef, onion, carrots, and celery. Add the broth and enough water to just cover the meat and cook, covered, until the corned beef is super-tender (a paring knife should slip easily into the meat), about 4 hours. Transfer the meat to a baking dish; trim and discard the fat, if desired. Strain and reserve the cooking liquid, and discard the solids. Pour about 1 cup of the liquid over the meat, cover the dish tightly with foil, and let rest for about 30 minutes.

Pour the strained cooking liquid into a fat separator or measuring cup and rest until the fat rises to the surface, about 10 minutes. If you are using a fat separator, pour the liquid into another container; if you are using a measuring cup, tilt it and use a wide, shallow soup spoon to skim any fat off the surface and discard it.

Return the liquid to the Dutch oven, add the potatoes, set the pot over medium-high heat, and bring to a simmer. Adjust the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes just begin to soften, about 8 minutes. Add the cabbage, submerge it in the liquid as best you can (arrange the potatoes among the cabbage wedges), replace the cover, adjust the heat to medium-high, and return to a simmer. Adjust the heat to medium-low and simmer until the potatoes and cabbage are both tender, 10 to 14 minutes more, turning over the cabbage wedges after 6 minutes.

Meanwhile, place the meat on a cutting board, slice it against the grain into thin slices, and set the slices on a large serving platter. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the vegetables to a large bowl and sprinkle them with salt, if necessary, and pepper to taste. Scatter the butter pieces over the vegetables, wait a moment for the butter to begin to melt, and gently turn over the vegetables to distribute the butter. Arrange the potatoes and cabbage around the meat on the platter, sprinkle the parsley over the meat and vegetables, and serve with vinegar on the side, if desired.
