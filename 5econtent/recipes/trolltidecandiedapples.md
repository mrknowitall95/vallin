## Trolltide Candied Apples

**Makes** 4 apples

4 apples, scrubbed clean and dried well

1¼ cups sugar

3 tablespoons light corn syrup

½ teaspoon red food coloring, plus more as needed (optional)

¼ cup water

¼ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

For best results, use hard, tart apples such as Honeycrisp or Granny Smith. Supermarket apples often have a coating to help protect them, so make sure to scrub your apples well and dry them thoroughly.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Working one at a time, spear each apple through the core end and most of the way through the fruit with a Popsicle stick or chopstick. Place the apples on the baking sheet.

In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup, food coloring (if using), and water and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Adjust the heat to medium and simmer, swirling the pan occasionally, until the mixture registers between 300° and 310°F on an instant-read, candy, or deep-fry thermometer, 15 to 18 minutes. Add the vanilla near the end of that time.

Working quickly, take the pan off the heat and tilt it to pool the candy mixture on one side. Dip the apples, one at a time, twirling them to coat entirely with the candy mixture. Hold each apple straight over the pot and allow the excess candy mixture to drip off. Return the apples to the parchment paper–lined baking sheet.

Allow the apples to cool, set, and dry for 20 minutes before serving.
