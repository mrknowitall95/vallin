## Ray of Frost

**Serves** 2

Small ice cubes

4 ounces gin (such as London Dry)

½ ounce absinthe

⅓ ounce dry vermouth

2 lemon twists

Chill two cocktail glasses, martini glasses, or coupes (see Cook's Note, this page). Fill a large mixing glass about halfway with ice and add the gin, absinthe, and vermouth. Stir to blend and chill, about 30 seconds. Strain between the two chilled glasses. Run a lemon twist around the rim of each glass and drop it in before serving.
