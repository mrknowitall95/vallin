## Gingerbread Man

**Makes** 24 cookies

#### Cookies

3 cups all-purpose flour

¾ cup packed dark brown sugar

1 tablespoon ground ginger

2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

¾ teaspoon baking soda

¾ teaspoon kosher salt

¾ teaspoon dry mustard powder

½ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg

⅛ teaspoon ground cloves

12 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled

⅔ cup unsulphured molasses (not blackstrap)

3 tablespoons whole milk

½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

#### Decoration

⅔ cup currants or raisins

⅓ cup very finely chopped toasted walnuts

1⅓ cups confectioners' sugar

1 egg white

¼ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Kosher salt

***Make the Cookies.*** In a food processor, combine the flour, brown sugar, ginger, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, mustard powder, nutmeg, and cloves. Pulse several times to mix. Add the melted butter, molasses, milk, and vanilla and process until the ingredients are combined into a dough with no remaining streaks of flour, 15 to 30 seconds, stopping to scrape down the sides of the work bowl as necessary.

Dust a work surface very lightly with flour, scrape the dough onto it, and knead briefly until the dough forms a cohesive ball. Divide the dough in half, shape each half into a disk ¾ to 1 inch thick, wrap each one in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.

Preheat the oven to 350°F with the racks in the upper-middle and lower-middle of the oven. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.

Working with one dough disk at a time, roll the dough between two large sheets of parchment paper into a circle about ¼ inch thick; the diameter should be about 11 inches, but the thickness is more important. Make sure the thickness is even from the center to the edges of the circle. Remove the top sheet of parchment and, with a 3½-inch gingerbread man cookie cutter, cut out as many cookies as possible. Peel away the dough scraps and carefully transfer the cut cookies to the prepared baking sheets, arranging them with about 1 inch space around them (about nine per sheet). Mash the dough scraps together and with the remaining refrigerated dough, roll out and cut as many cookies as possible. Not all of the cookies will fit on the two sheets, necessitating a second round of baking. Make sure the cookie sheets cool before loading them with more cookies to bake.

Bake until the cookies are just set around the edges and slightly puffed, 9 to 11 minutes, rotating the sheets 180 degrees and switching racks midway through the baking. Cool the cookies on the baking sheets for 10 minutes, transfer them to wire racks, and cool completely before decorating.

***Decorate the Cookies.*** Spread the currants on a plate, pick through them to remove any especially large ones, and reserve. In a small bowl, mix ⅓ cup of the tiny currants and the walnuts, and set aside.

With a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, or a handheld electric mixer, beat the confectioners' sugar, egg white, vanilla, a pinch of salt, and 1 teaspoon water on medium-low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Adjust the speed to medium-high and beat until glossy, soft peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes, stopping to scrape down the bowl as necessary.

On each cooled cookie, spread about ½ teaspoon icing around the midriff, as if making a cummerbund. Working quickly while the icing is still tacky, sprinkle a scant 1 teaspoon of the currant-walnut mixture evenly over each cummerbund, pressing it gently to help it adhere.

Scrape the remaining icing into a small sandwich or ziplock plastic bag and, using your hands or a bench scraper, push it into one lower corner of the bag. Cut off 1/16 inch from the very corner of the bag and pipe two eyes and two thin lines of icing on the arms and legs of each cookie. For the mouth, pipe a ¼-inch dot of icing and press a large currant into it. Allow to dry for about 45 minutes. Serve or store in an airtight container for up to 2 days.
