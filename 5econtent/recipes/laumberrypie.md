## Laumberry Pie

**Serves** 2

2 frozen piecrusts (for one double-crust pie), thawed according to the package directions until cooler than room temperature and pliable

7 cups mixed fresh blackberries and blueberries, rinsed and very gently dried with paper towels

½ to ⅔ cup granulated sugar (depending on the berries' sweetness)

3½ tablespoons cornstarch

¼ teaspoon kosher salt

1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

½ teaspoon vanilla extract

⅓ cup apple or red currant jelly

1 cup fresh raspberries, rinsed and very gently dried with paper towels

Four 5-inch pie plates

You'll need four 5-inch pie plates.

On a floured work surface or sheet of parchment paper, roll out one of the piecrusts into an oval about 14 inches long and 7 inches wide. Cut out two 7-inch circles of dough and fit each into individual 5-inch pie plates. Fold under any overhanging dough to be even with the edge of the rim. Place your thumb and index finger on the folded edge of crust and press between them with the index finger of your other hand. Work your way around the crust in this manner to create a decorative wavy rim. Repeat with the second piecrust. Cover the dough-lined plates with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for about 30 minutes.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 350°F.

Place the partially frozen dough-lined plates on a rimmed baking sheet. Line the doughs with aluminum foil, and fill with pie weights, making sure there are enough to reach most of the way up the sides.

Bake the crusts until the edges are set and just beginning to turn golden, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through. Carefully remove the foil and weights and continue baking until the crusts are light golden brown and crisp, about 12 minutes longer, again rotating the baking sheet halfway through (cover the edges of the crusts with foil if they begin to darken too much). Transfer the piecrusts to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature.

Place 2 cups of the mixed blackberries and blueberries in a medium bowl and set aside.

In a food processor, puree the remaining 5 cups mixed blackberries and blueberries until broken down and smooth, about 1 minute. Strain the puree through a fine-mesh strainer into a medium nonreactive saucepan (such as stainless steel), scraping and pressing on the solids to extract as much puree as possible, and scraping the puree off the bottom of the strainer into the saucepan. In a small bowl, combine ½ cup sugar, the cornstarch, and salt and whisk to incorporate; then whisk that mixture into the berry puree. Taste and add the remaining sugar, if necessary.

Set the saucepan over medium heat and bring the berry mixture to a strong simmer, stirring and scraping the pan bottom constantly. Cook until the mixture is thickened and pudding-like and bubbles start to break the surface, about 20 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat, add the lemon juice and vanilla, and whisk to combine. Let the puree cool slightly.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat, warm the apple jelly until runny, stirring to smooth out lumps. Drizzle the melted jelly over the reserved blackberries and blueberries and toss gently to coat. Add the raspberries and toss very gently to coat and mix with the other berries.

Scrape one-fourth of the slightly cooled berry puree into each cooled piecrust, and top each with ¾ cup of the glazed fresh berries. Loosely cover the pies with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until chilled and the puree has set, about 3 hours or up to 1 day, before serving.
