## Brackleberry Jam

**Makes** about 1¼ cups

2 cups lightly packed, chopped fresh strawberries (see Cook's Note)

½ cup fresh blueberries

½ cup fresh blackberries

½ cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar

1½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice

1 small pinch kosher salt

To chop the strawberries, hull them, cut each one in quarters lengthwise (large ones in sixths), turn the pieces 90 degrees, and cut them in half crosswise.

Place a small plate in the freezer to chill.

In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, sugar, lemon juice, and salt and bring to a strong boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Continue boiling for 5 minutes to soften the berries. Remove from the heat and, using a large slotted spoon or handheld potato masher, mash the berries thoroughly. Return to medium-high heat and continue to boil until the mixture is reduced and slightly thickened, just verging on a jammy consistency, 15 to 18 minutes longer.

Remove the plate from the freezer and drop about 1 teaspoon of the jam on it. Wait about 15 seconds and then run your finger through the jam. If it leaves a clean trail, the jam is done. If the jam runs back into the trail, return the plate to the freezer, turn the heat to medium, simmer the jam for 2 to 4 minutes longer before retesting. When the jam is done, transfer it to a heatproof jar and set aside to cool to room temperature (it will thicken as it cools). Cover with a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate for up to 3 weeks.
