## High Harvest Puree

**Serves** 4

One 4-pound butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes

4 large garlic cloves, unpeeled

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1½ teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme

Mashing the squash right on the baking sheet yields a dense, rustic puree. If you want to make it smooth, scrape the squash and peeled garlic into a food processor and pulse or process it to a desired smoothness. If you want a looser consistency, with the processor running, gradually add ½ to ⅔ cup of hot water through the feed tube.

Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.

In a large bowl, toss the squash and garlic cloves with the olive oil. Add ¾ teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and toss to distribute. On a large rimmed baking sheet, spread out the squash into a single layer and roast until tender, about 30 minutes. Sprinkle the thyme over the squash, stir it in, and continue to roast for 10 minutes more. Set the baking sheet on a stable, heatproof surface.

Slip the peels off the garlic cloves; discard the peels and return the cloves to the squash. With a potato masher, mash the squash to a desired texture. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary. Scrape the puree into a serving bowl, drizzle with olive oil, and serve.
