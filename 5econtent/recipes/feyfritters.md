## Fey Fritters

**Makes** about fourteen 3-inch fritters

4 cups water

Kosher salt

2 cups frozen (not thawed) or fresh green peas

2 eggs, beaten

⅓ cup whole milk, plus more as needed

⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley

¼ cup minced shallot

1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest

1 teaspoon baking powder

Freshly ground black pepper

½ cup all-purpose flour

½ cup coarsely crumbled feta

Neutral oil for panfrying

If you like, accompany the fritters with a small bowl of crème fraîche or a plain Greek yogurt accented with a little olive oil, lemon juice, chopped fresh mint or scallions, salt, and pepper.

Set a colander in the sink. Fill a large bowl with ice water and set aside. Line a plate with paper towels.

In a medium saucepan over high heat, bring the water to a rapid boil. Add ½ teaspoon salt and the peas, cover, and cook until bright green and just tender, about 2 minutes for frozen or 3 to 4 minutes for fresh (the water probably won't return to a full boil). Drain the peas in the colander and immediately place them in the ice water to stop the cooking. Drain the peas again and spread them on the prepared plate to dry. Set aside ⅓ cup.

Transfer the remaining peas to a food processor and pulse to a coarse puree, three or four 2-second pulses, then scrape the puree into a medium bowl. Add the reserved whole peas, eggs, milk, parsley, shallot, lemon zest, baking powder, and 1½ teaspoons salt; season with pepper; and stir to blend. Add the flour and, using a flexible spatula, fold it into the pea mixture. Add the feta and continue folding until no dry patches remain. This batter should be about the texture of a thick, chunky applesauce; if it's too thick, add more milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, folding to incorporate until the proper texture is attained.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 250°F. Line a large plate or platter with paper towels and set aside.

In a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm 2 tablespoons neutral oil until shimmering. Gauge the oil temperature and seasoning by placing about 1 tablespoon batter in the center of the skillet and cook until the fritter is lightly browned on the bottom, about 1 minute (the oil around the fritters should bubble gently). Flip the fritter and cook until the second side is browned, about 1 minute longer. If it is too light or too dark, adjust the heat accordingly and retest. Taste and adjust the seasoning of the batter with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

Working in batches, scoop roughly 3-tablespoon portions of the batter into the pan, spreading them into 3-inch rounds, with about 1 inch between them. Cook, undisturbed, until tiny bubbles appear on the surface and the bottom is browned, 2½ to 3 minutes. Using a spatula, gently flip the fritters and cook, undisturbed, until the second side is well browned, 1½ to 2 minutes longer. Transfer the fritters to the prepared plate and place in the oven to keep warm. Repeat to cook the remaining batter, adding more oil to equal about 2 tablespoons when necessary. Serve the fritters warm, as soon as the last batch has cooked.
