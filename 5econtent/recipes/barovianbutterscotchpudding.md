## Barovian Butterscotch Pudding

**Serves** 4

¼ cup unsalted butter

⅔ cup packed dark brown sugar

2 tablespoons water

1½ tablespoons light corn syrup

1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

¾ teaspoon kosher salt

¾ cup heavy cream

2 cups whole milk

3 egg yolks

3 tablespoons cornstarch

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

1 tablespoon Scotch or Irish whiskey (see Cook's Note)

Very lightly sweetened whipped cream for serving

Avoid using a heavily peated Scotch, which can overwhelm the dish with smokiness.

In a heavy saucepan over medium heat, combine the butter, brown sugar, water, corn syrup, lemon juice, and salt. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally to melt the butter and dissolve the sugar. Continue cooking at a rolling boil, stirring occasionally, until the mixture registers 240°F on an instant-read or candy thermometer, about 3 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium-low and simmer gently (the mixture should bubble lazily and steadily—if not, adjust the heat accordingly), stirring frequently, until the mixture registers 300° to 310°F on the thermometer and has a bittersweet, borderline burnt fragrance, about 6 minutes more.

Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk together the cream and milk to combine. In another bowl, whisk the yolks, cornstarch, and a little of the cream-milk mixture until uniform; take care to work out any tiny lumps of cornstarch.

Remove the pan with the brown-sugar caramel mixture from the heat. Very carefully pour in about ½ cup of the cream-milk mixture; the mixture will bubble, steam, and possibly splatter. Whisk vigorously, but with care, for about 1 minute, reaching into the corners of the pan. If some of the caramel mixture is seized or still stuck in the corners of the pan, it will re-melt and loosen again. Return the pan to medium heat and, whisking constantly, add the remaining cream-milk mixture; continue whisking until any bits of seized caramel have melted fully and the mixture just reaches a simmer, about 3 minutes.

Whisking constantly, gradually add about ½ cup of the caramel to the egg yolks. Again whisking constantly, add the egg mixture to the pan and continue to cook, whisking constantly, for 1 minute more. Remove from the heat, add the vanilla and Scotch, and whisk to incorporate.

Set a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl. Pour in the pudding and, with a flexible spatula, fold and stir the pudding gently to work it through the strainer. With a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap, cover the pudding, pressing the paper or wrap directly onto the pudding surface.

Refrigerate until cold and set, at least 4 or up to 24 hours. At serving time, stir the pudding gently until smooth, then top with the whipped cream.
