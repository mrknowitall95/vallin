## Gully Dwarf Homestyle Porridge

**Serves** 4

1½ tablespoons unsalted butter

1 cup steel-cut oats

3¼ cups water

½ cup low-fat or whole milk

¼ teaspoon kosher salt

3 tablespoons light brown sugar, plus 4 teaspoons for garnish

2 tablespoons heavy cream or half-and-half for garnish

Cooking oats in a mixture of water and milk provides a good balance of richness (using all milk can make the porridge overly rich, especially once the cream garnish is added).

Add the water to the toasted oats before the milk, otherwise it might foam up.

The oatmeal will continue to thicken as it cools, so make sure to serve it hot.

In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the oats and cook, stirring constantly, until they smell fragrant, nutty, and toasty and look a shade darker, about 4 minutes.

Add the water, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly. Add the milk, adjust the heat to medium-low and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is thickened to the consistency of applesauce and the oats are tender but chewy, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the salt and 3 tablespoons brown sugar and stir to incorporate.

Remove the pan from the heat, cover, and let rest for about 5 minutes; the oatmeal will thicken to about the consistency of pudding. Serve at once, topping each serving evenly with about 1½ teaspoons cream and 1 teaspoon brown sugar.
