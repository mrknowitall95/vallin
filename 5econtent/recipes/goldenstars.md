## Goldenstars

**Makes** about 15 pastries

#### Dough

2½ cups all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons granulated sugar

1 tablespoon onion powder

½ teaspoon baking powder

1 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

2 eggs

½ cup neutral oil

¼ cup water

#### Filling

1½ teaspoons neutral oil

1 four-ounce mild-flavored fresh sausage, casing removed (see Cook's Note)

¾ cup diced (about ⅜-inch cubes) peeled Yukon gold potato

¼ cup water

Kosher salt

1 tablespoon unsalted butter

1¼ cups loosely packed very thinly sliced leeks (white and light green parts; halved lengthwise before slicing)

1½ teaspoons chopped fresh thyme

1½ tablespoons all-purpose flour

¾ cup low-sodium chicken broth

Freshly ground black pepper

¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

#### Egg Wash

1 egg

1 tablespoon water

Fresh sausages come in a variety of sizes and flavors. Choose a mild flavor such as spinach or roasted garlic and steer clear of strong, spicy, or smoky flavors. Turkey sausage is fine here, if you prefer it.

If you don't have a 4-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, you can use a small dish 4 inches in diameter with a thin rim to cut the dough rounds.

A bench scraper is a useful and inexpensive tool. You can use it to level flour in a measuring cup, or batter in a baking pan, in addition to loosening dough from a work surface.

Goldenstars can be wrapped in aluminum foil and refrigerated for up to 4 days. Before serving, reheat in a 350°F oven, still wrapped in foil, until warmed through, about 30 minutes.

***To make the dough:.*** In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, onion powder, baking powder, salt, and pepper and whisk together. In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, neutral oil, and water and whisk until uniform. Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture and, using a flexible spatula, fold until incorporated into a dough.

Turn the dough onto a work surface and knead briefly until it comes together. Divide in half and pat each half into a roughly 6-inch disc. Place the discs side by side in the bowl or on a plate, cover with a kitchen towel, and let rest for about 1 hour.

***To make the filling:.*** Line a small plate with a paper towel and set aside.

In a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm the neutral oil. Add the sausage and cook, stirring and breaking it into small crumbles, until it no longer appears raw, about 3 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to the prepared plate, leaving as much of the rendered fat in the skillet as possible.

Return the skillet to medium heat. Add the potato, water, and 1 pinch salt and cook, covered, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until the potato starts to soften, about 6 minutes. Add the butter and let melt, swirling to coat the pan. Add the leek, thyme, and 1 pinch salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Slowly add the chicken broth, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the skillet to dissolve the browned bits, and cook until thickened, about 1½ minutes (the texture will be quite thick, almost like loose mashed potatoes). Add the reserved sausage and stir to incorporate. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the mixture cool until barely warm, 10 to 15 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Stir in the parsley.

With racks in the upper- and lower-middle positions, preheat the oven to 375°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick baking mats, and set aside.

***To make the egg wash:.*** In a small bowl, whisk the egg and water until uniformly yellow. Set aside.

On a generously floured work surface, roll out one of the dough discs into a roughly 12-inch circle no more ¼ inch thick. Using a 4-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out four or five rounds. Gather the dough scraps into a mass, return to the bowl or plate, and cover.

If necessary, use a bench scraper to gently loosen the dough rounds from the work surface. Place about 1½ tablespoons of the filling in the center of each round. Lightly brush the edges of each round with the egg wash. Working with one at a time, form a triangle by folding three "sides" up and over the filling, leaving about 1 inch of filling uncovered. Pinch the edges together well (so they won't come apart as they bake). Place on a prepared baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.

Clean the work surface, if necessary, flour it generously, and repeat the process with the second dough disc, rolling the dough, cutting, filling, shaping, and sealing the rounds. Add the collected scraps to those from the first disc.

Clean the work surface, if necessary. Knead the collected dough scraps into a cohesive mass, pat it into a roughly 6-inch disc, cover, and let rest for about 15 minutes. Flour the work surface generously, and roll out, cut, fill, shape, and seal about five to seven final rounds. Transfer the pastries to the prepared baking sheets. Brush the three sides of the pastries (but not the exposed filling) with egg wash.

Bake the goldenstars until light golden and the filling is bubbling, about 25 minutes, swapping and rotating the baking sheets halfway through. Let the pastries cool on the baking sheets for about 5 minutes, then transfer them to wire racks and let cool until barely warm or room temperature before serving.
