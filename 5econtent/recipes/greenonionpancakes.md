## Green Onion Pancakes

**Serves** 3 to 4 as an appetizer

⅓ cup all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons onion powder

½ teaspoon baking powder

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

⅓ cup crème fraîche (see Cook's Note)

1½ tablespoons whole milk or half-and-half, plus more as needed

1 egg, beaten

¼ cup very cold water, plus more as needed

1½ teaspoons soy sauce

1½ tablespoons neutral oil

½ cup finely shredded green cabbage, massaged with your hands to soften

1 small carrot, peeled and grated on the large holes of a box grater

16 scallions, trimmed, whites thinly sliced and greens cut into 2-inch lengths

You can substitute sour cream or plain Greek yogurt for the crème fraîche.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 250°F. Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet and set aside.

In a small bowl, combine the flour, onion powder, baking powder, and 1½ teaspoons salt; season with pepper; whisk to incorporate; and set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the crème fraîche and milk and whisk to a thick, barely pourable consistency, adding more milk, about 1 teaspoon at a time, as needed. Using a flexible spatula, scrape the mixture into a small serving dish and put in the refrigerator.

In the medium bowl, combine the egg, water, soy sauce, and 1½ teaspoons of the neutral oil and whisk until well blended. Add the flour mixture and whisk to form a loose, smooth batter with the consistency of applesauce, adding more water by the teaspoon (up to 4 teaspoons), if necessary. Add the cabbage, carrot, and scallions; mix to coat the vegetables with batter; and let rest for about 5 minutes.

In a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm 1½ teaspoons neutral oil until shimmering. Stir the batter mixture, add half of it to the skillet, and immediately spread it into a roughly 7-inch round. Cook, undisturbed, until well browned on the bottom, about 3½ minutes. With a rubber spatula, flip the pancake and cook the second side, adjusting the heat if necessary, until the second side is spotted with brown, about 3½ minutes longer. Transfer the pancake to the prepared rack and place in the oven to keep warm. Add the remaining 1½ teaspoons neutral oil to the skillet, warm until shimmering, and repeat to cook the remaining batter into a second pancake. Transfer the pancake from the oven to a plate, add the second pancake, and set them aside to cool for about 4 minutes. Cut the pancakes into wedges and serve with the crème fraîche mixture.
