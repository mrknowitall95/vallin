## Sprucebark Quaff

**Makes** about 1½ quarts

4 large sprigs mint

½ large English cucumber, peeled and thinly sliced

6 cups cold water

Slapping the mint sprigs against your palm several times helps the leaves to release their flavor and fragrance.

Adding 1 or 2 thin slices of lemon imparts a subtle citrusy note.

In a large pitcher combine the mint, cucumber, and water. Refrigerate for 2 hours to infuse before serving.
