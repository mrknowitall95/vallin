## Steak of the Deep

**Serves** 4

⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling

1 medium yellow onion, chopped

1 bay leaf

Kosher salt

3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced

1½ teaspoons paprika

½ cup Amontillado or Fino sherry, plus 2 teaspoons

One 14½-ounce can petite-diced tomatoes

Freshly ground black pepper

1½ pounds swordfish steak, about 1 inch thick

¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

If the sauce cools to room temperature and becomes too thick and sticky, set the pan over medium-low heat until it's warm and viscous again.

In a braising pan or large sauté pan over medium heat, warm the olive oil. Add the onion, bay leaf, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the onion starts to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and paprika and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute longer. Add the ½ cup sherry, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a strong simmer. Let simmer, stirring, for about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and ¾ teaspoon salt and season with pepper. Return to a simmer and cook, stirring, to blend the flavors, about 3 minutes.

Sprinkle the swordfish on both sides with salt and pepper and nestle it into the tomato mixture. Adjust the heat to low, cover, and cook until the swordfish is opaque, just firm to the touch, and registers 130°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 25 minutes, turning it over halfway through cooking. Transfer the swordfish to a serving platter, leaving the sauce in the pan. Tent the fish loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, adjust the heat to medium-high and bring the sauce to a strong simmer. Add most of the parsley and the remaining 2 teaspoons sherry, and stir to blend. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

Top the swordfish with the tomato sauce, drizzle with olive oil, and sprinkle with the remaining parsley before serving.
