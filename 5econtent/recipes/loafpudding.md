## Loaf Pudding

**Makes** one 8½ by 4½-inch loaf

#### Loaf

1⅓ cups all-purpose flour

⅔ cup almond meal

2 teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon kosher salt

8 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into chunks

¾ cup granulated sugar

3 eggs

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

½ teaspoon almond extract

½ cup plain yogurt (preferably whole-milk)

3 tablespoons sliced almonds

#### Syrup

¼ cup granulated sugar

3 tablespoons water

1 small pinch kosher salt

½ teaspoon vanilla extract

¼ teaspoon almond extract

A bamboo skewer is ideal for poking holes in the loaf.

The loaf has a fragile crumb, made more so by the syrup, so use a serrated knife to slice it as neatly as you can.

***To make the loaf:.*** With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 350°F. Coat an 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat, place a wire rack on top, and set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, almond meal, baking powder, and salt; whisk to incorporate; and set aside.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or with a handheld mixer, on medium-high speed, beat the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a flexible spatula once or twice. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla and almond extract, beat well, and scrape down the sides of the bowl again.

Adjust the mixer speed to low. Add about one-third of the flour mixture, followed by half of the yogurt, mixing after each addition until just incorporated, about 5 seconds. Repeat with half of the remaining flour mixture, followed by all the remaining yogurt. Scrape down the sides of the bowl again and add the remaining flour mixture. Adjust the speed to medium-low and mix just until the batter is smooth (do not overmix).

Using a flexible spatula, scrape the batter into the prepared loaf pan, smooth the top, and sprinkle the sliced almonds down the center, pressing them lightly to help adhere.

Bake the loaf until the top is browned, the edges begin to pull away from the pan, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes (do not overbake), rotating the pan halfway through. Let the loaf cool in the pan for 8 minutes. Loosen the sides of the loaf and carefully turn it out (the pan will still be hot) onto the prepared rack and set right-side up.

***To make the syrup:.*** In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, water, and salt and bring to a steamy simmer, constantly swirling the pan to dissolve the sugar, about 3 minutes. Continue simmering until glossy bubbles develop and the liquid is slightly thickened, about 3 minutes longer. Let the syrup cool to room temperature, add the vanilla and almond extract, and swirl to incorporate them.

While the loaf is still hot, use a long, thin skewer to poke deep holes (but don't go all the way through) on its bottom and sides, as well as along both sides of the almonds on top. Brush the syrup over the holes all over the loaf, working slowly to allow it to be absorbed. Return the loaf to the rack to cool to room temperature, if necessary. Slice and serve. Wrap in plastic wrap and store at room temperature for up to 2 days.
