## Irlymeyer's Dragonfire Punch

**Makes** about 2½ quarts

3 cups cranberry juice cocktail

⅓ cup frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed

½ cup frozen pineapple juice concentrate, thawed

3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

1 cup brandy

1 cup large ice cubes (see Cook's Note), plus more for serving

One 750 ml bottle Prosecco or other sparkling wine, cold

1 large orange, scrubbed and thinly sliced

A small block of ice will melt more slowly than the cup of ice cubes. To make such a block, fill a 1-quart plastic container (such as a deli container) with water and freeze it overnight. To loosen the block of ice from the container, hold it briefly under hot running water.

In a large bowl or pitcher, combine the cranberry juice cocktail, orange juice concentrate, pineapple juice concentrate, lemon juice, and brandy and stir to blend. (This mix can be made 1 day ahead, covered, and refrigerated.)

When ready to serve, add the ice to the mix and stir to chill and blend. Add the Prosecco and stir gently. Fill each glass with ice, pour in the punch, and garnish with an orange slice.
