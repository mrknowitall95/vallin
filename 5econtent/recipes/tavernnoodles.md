## Tavern Noodles

**Serves** 4 to 6

⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil

3 large onions, halved from pole to pole and thinly sliced lengthwise

Kosher salt

1½ teaspoons minced fresh rosemary or thyme

2 teaspoons pressed or grated garlic

½ cup dry white wine

12 ounces fettuccine, tagliatelle, or pappardelle

¾ cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving

Freshly ground black pepper

⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley

3 hard-cooked eggs, peeled and chopped

In a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm 3 tablespoons of the olive oil until shimmering. Add the onions and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and light gold, about 30 minutes. Add the rosemary and 1 teaspoon of the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the wine, adjust the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced by half, about 2½ minutes.

While the onions are cooking, in a large pot over high heat, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add 1 tablespoon salt and the fettuccine and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until just barely al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot. Adjust the heat to medium-low, add the onion mixture to the pasta, toss, and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove the pan from the heat, add the remaining 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon olive oil, remaining 1 teaspoon garlic, the Parmesan, and 1 teaspoon salt. Season with pepper and toss well. Add between ½ cup and 1 cup of the reserved cooking water to loosen the sauce and distribute the ingredients evenly. Add most of the parsley and toss. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary, and transfer the pasta into a serving dish. Sprinkle with the chopped egg and remaining parsley before serving.
