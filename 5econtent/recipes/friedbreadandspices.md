## Fried Bread and Spices

**Makes** 6 slices

2½ teaspoons paprika

1 teaspoon ground cumin

1 teaspoon ground coriander

1 teaspoon ground fennel

1 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper

6 slices country, French, or Italian bread, ¾ inch thick and about 5 inches wide

½ cup extra-virgin olive oil

1 garlic clove (optional)

In a small bowl, combine the paprika, cumin, coriander, fennel, salt, black pepper, and cayenne and stir to incorporate. Brush both sides of each bread slice with about 2 teaspoons of the olive oil.

In a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, place as many slices of bread as will fit in a single layer. Cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Near the end of that time, sprinkle about 1 teaspoon of the spice mixture evenly over each slice of bread. Carefully flip the bread so the spiced side is down and continue to cook until lightly browned on the second side and fragrant, about 1½ minutes longer. Remove the bread from the pan, and repeat to cook the remaining slices. Rub each slice lightly on either side with the garlic clove, if desired, before serving.
