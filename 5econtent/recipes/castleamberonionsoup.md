## Castle Amber Onion Soup

**Serves** 4

4 tablespoons unsalted butter

4 pounds (about 8) yellow onions, thinly sliced

Kosher salt

2 bay leaves

1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, finely chopped

1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

½ cup dry sherry or dry white wine

4 cups low-sodium chicken broth

1½ cups low-sodium beef broth

Freshly ground black pepper

8 thin slices from a baguette

1 garlic clove, peeled and halved

1¼ cups grated Gruyère cheese

2 tablespoons snipped chives for garnish

In a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter. Add the onions and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 10 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium, add the bay leaves, and continue cooking, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally, until the onions are light gold and sticky, about 1½ hours (adjust the heat as necessary to make sure they are caramelizing, not scorching).

Adjust the heat to medium-low. Add ¼ cup water and scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen and dissolve the brown bits. Continue to cook until the pot bottom is coated again, about 12 minutes, stirring and scraping occasionally. Add another ¼ cup water, and repeat this cooking and deglazing process two more times until all the water has evaporated and the onions are dark brown, about 12 minutes longer each time. Add the thyme and flour and continue to cook, stirring constantly, for about 3 minutes.

Add the sherry to the pot, adjust the heat to medium-high, and continue to cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot constantly, for about 3 minutes longer. Add the chicken broth, beef broth, and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Adjust the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, to blend the flavors, about 30 minutes. Remove the bay leaves and stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Taste and adjust the seasoning with pepper and additional salt, if necessary.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Arrange the baguette slices on a baking sheet and bake until lightly golden, about 10 minutes, turning them over midway through that time.

Preheat the broiler and carefully set the oven rack about 6 inches below the heat element. Lightly rub each toast with the raw garlic clove; sprinkle with pepper and the Gruyère, and broil until the cheese is melted and browned in spots, about 4 minutes.

Ladle the soup into four warmed bowls, garnish with two cheese toasts each, sprinkle with the chives, and serve at once.
