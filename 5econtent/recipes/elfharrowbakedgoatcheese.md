## Elfharrow Baked Goat Cheese

**Serves** 6

3 ounces plain Melba toast

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

½ cup minced shallots

1 egg

2 teaspoons Dijon mustard

One 10- to 12-ounce log firm, mild goat cheese, cut into 12 equal slices (see Cook's Note)

1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar

2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice

¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing

12 cups loosely packed mixed salad greens or mesclun

1 apple or pear, cored and thinly sliced (optional)

3 tablespoons snipped fresh chives

To quickly and neatly slice the goat cheese, use a cheese slicer with a wire cutter. If you don't have one, you can use a length of dental floss, wrapping the ends around your index fingers so that it's taut.

If you prefer, you can use olive oil cooking spray to coat the frozen cheese rounds, rather than brushing them with olive oil.

In a food processor, combine the Melba toast and ½ teaspoon salt, season with pepper, and process until you have fine, uniform crumbs, about the texture of wheat germ. Add ¼ cup of the minced shallots and pulse to combine. Transfer the mixture to a shallow dish. In a second shallow dish, beat the egg and 1 teaspoon of the mustard until uniform. Dip a slice of goat cheese into the egg, covering both sides and the edges. Then dip into the Melba toast mixture, gently pressing the crumbs onto the cheese to form a thick coating, and place on a plate. Repeat with the remaining cheese slices, adding them to the plate as you go. Put the plate in the freezer and freeze until the cheese is very firm, about 45 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a large nonreactive bowl, combine the vinegar, lemon juice, remaining 1 teaspoon mustard, and ½ teaspoon salt; season with pepper; and whisk to incorporate. Stir in the remaining ¼ cup shallots and set aside for the flavors to blend, about 10 minutes. While whisking vigorously, add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream to blend and emulsify into a dressing. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary, and set aside.

With a rack in the upper position, preheat the oven to 475°F. Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet.

Place the frozen cheese rounds on the rack, then brush lightly all over with olive oil. Bake until the coating is deep golden brown and the cheese is slightly soft, 9 to 14 minutes. Let the cheese cool on the wire rack for about 2 minutes.

Whisk the dressing to recombine. Add the greens and apple (if using) to the dressing and toss to coat. Divide the greens among six serving plates, place two cheese rounds on each, and sprinkle with some of the chives. Serve immediately.
