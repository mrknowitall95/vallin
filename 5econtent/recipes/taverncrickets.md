## Tavern Crickets

**Makes** 3 cups

1½ tablespoons chile-lime seasoning (such as Tajín)

2 teaspoons garlic powder

½ teaspoon cayenne pepper

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 cup roasted and salted peanuts

1 cup raw pepitas

1 cup whole roasted crickets

2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 300°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat.

In a small bowl, combine the chile-lime seasoning, garlic powder, cayenne, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon black pepper and whisk to incorporate. Set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the peanuts, pepitas, and crickets and stir to blend. Add the melted butter, stir, and toss to coat the mixture evenly. Add the spice mixture and toss again to coat. Evenly spread the mixture on the prepared baking sheet.

Bake the crickets until dry and fragrant, about 20 minutes, stirring well three times during the baking time. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Let cool to room temperature.

Tavern Crickets can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
