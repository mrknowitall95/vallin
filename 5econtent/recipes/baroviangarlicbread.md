## Barovian Garlic Bread

**Makes** 12 knots

4 tablespoons unsalted butter

2 tablespoons pressed or grated garlic

1½ teaspoons water

Kosher salt

All-purpose flour for dusting

1 pound pizza dough, at room temperature

With a rack in the upper-middle position, preheat the oven to 475°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat, place a wire rack on the baking sheet, and set aside.

In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter; add the garlic and water; and cook, stirring frequently, until the garlic is pale gold and very fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and stir to melt. Remove the pan from the heat and let the mixture rest to infuse with the garlic flavor, about 10 minutes.

Set a fine-mesh strainer over a small, microwave-safe bowl and strain the garlic butter, pressing on the solids to squeeze out as much butter as possible. Stir ½ teaspoon salt into the butter and set aside.

Generously dust a work surface with flour. Put the pizza dough on the surface and shape into a 12-inch log. Using a bench knife, cut the log crosswise into quarters and then cut each quarter into thirds. Roll each of the twelve dough pieces into an 8- to 9-inch rope and tie each rope into a simple knot. Tuck the ends underneath the knot. Place the knots, about 2 inches apart, on the prepared rack.

Bake the knots until they are just set, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush with half the garlic butter. Rotate the baking sheet 180 degrees from its original position, return to the oven, and continue baking until the knots are lightly browned on the top, about 7 minutes longer. (Meanwhile, if the remaining garlic butter has hardened, microwave it for about 15 seconds at partial power to melt.) Remove the knots from the oven and immediately brush them with the remaining garlic butter. Sprinkle lightly with salt, let cool for 5 minutes, and then serve warm.
