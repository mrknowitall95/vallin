## Cocoa Broth

**Serves** 4

½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder, preferably Dutch-processed

½ cup packed light brown sugar, or to taste

¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon

½ teaspoon ground cardamom

Pinch of kosher salt

1 cup water

2½ cups whole milk

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

1½ cups espresso or very strong black coffee, hot

Marshmallows, for serving (optional)

In a saucepan over medium heat, whisk together the cocoa powder, brown sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, salt, and water until smooth. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook, whisking constantly, for about 2 minutes, making sure the whisk gets into the edges of the pan. Whisk in the milk and bring to a simmer (do not boil), whisking frequently, about 10 minutes. Whisk in the vanilla and espresso. Taste and adjust the flavor with additional brown sugar, if desired. Divide among four mugs, add the marshmallow (if using), and serve.
