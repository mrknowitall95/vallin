## Mushroom Tea

**Serves** 4

2 (5- to 6-inch long by 3-inch wide) strips kombu (dried kelp), lightly wiped with a damp cloth

4½ cups water

2 ounces (about 5) fresh shiitake mushrooms, stems removed and caps very thinly sliced

1 tablespoon soy sauce

¾ teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste

2 tablespoons sake

2 scallions, white and light green parts, thinly sliced, for garnish

Sometimes packages of kombu are labeled "Dashi Kombu" (dashi being the traditional Japanese broth of which kombu is a main component).

Serve this savory tea in mugs, for sipping, along with spoons for eating the mushrooms and scallions.

In a saucepan, submerge the kombu in the water and let rest until softened, about 30 minutes. Set the pan over medium heat and bring the water to a simmer, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the kombu and discard. Adjust the heat to medium-high and bring the liquid to a boil, about 3 minutes. Stir in the shiitakes, soy sauce, and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shiitakes are tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the sake. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, if necessary. Serve, sprinkling a portion of the scallions over each serving.
