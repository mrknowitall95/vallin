## Dwarven Flatbread

**Serves** 4

1½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting

1½ teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon baking soda

1½ teaspoons kosher salt

2½ teaspoons dried herb blend (such as Italian seasoning, herbes de Provence, or za'atar), crushed

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

⅔ cup plain low-fat Greek yogurt or whole milk

¼ cup neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

Skillet breads are a great canvas for customizing with simple toppings, such as finely chopped roasted red pepper or caramelized onions, or a schmear of ricotta cheese, added just before serving.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and herb blend to combine. Make a well in the center, add the olive oil and yogurt. With a wooden spoon or your hands, stir around the perimeter of the well to incorporate the wet and dry ingredients; the mixture will look a little rough and shaggy.

Lightly flour a work surface, scoop the dough onto it, and knead until the dough is smooth and uniform, adding a tiny amount of flour as you go if the dough becomes too sticky. Divide the dough into eight equal portions, gently roll each portion into a ball, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let rest for 15 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 200°F (or the lowest temperature possible) with a rack in the middle of the oven.

With a rolling pin, roll one of the dough balls into a circle about 7 inches in diameter and ¼ inch thick. In a 10-inch heavy skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium heat, warm 1½ teaspoons of the vegetable oil until shimmering. Tilt the skillet to coat the entire cooking surface with oil, carefully place the dough circle in the skillet, and cook, undisturbed, until spotty brown on the bottom and slightly puffed, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the bread over and continue to cook, undisturbed, until the second side is spotty brown as well, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer the bread to a baking sheet or ovenproof plate and place it in the oven to stay warm. Working with one dough ball and 1½ teaspoons oil at a time, repeat to roll, cook, and keep the remaining rounds warm. Note that as the pan accumulates and retains heat from previous batches, the cooking time may decrease by up to a minute. Serve warm and fresh
