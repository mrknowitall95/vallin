## Traveler's Stew

**Serves** 6

¼ cup all-purpose flour

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1½ pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch pieces

1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more as needed

1 cup dark beer

4 cups low-sodium beef broth

1 teaspoon sweet paprika

1 large yellow onion, chopped

2 carrots, peeled and cut into ½-inch rounds

3 Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces

¼ cup chopped fresh parsley

Most stews are made with broth and a small amount of wine, but this one utilizes dark beer. The beer infuses the stew with an earthy and faintly malty flavor.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and several grinds of pepper. Add the beef and toss to coat well.

Warm the oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add one-third to half of the beef—do not crowd—and cook for about 5 minutes, turning to brown all sides evenly. Transfer the browned beef to a plate and repeat to brown the remaining beef, adding more oil, if needed, between batches.

Pour the beer into the pot and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits. Return the browned beef to the pot and add the broth and paprika. Adjust the heat to low, cover, and cook at a simmer until the meat is very tender, 1½ to 2 hours.

Add the onion, carrots, and potatoes to the pot, and continue to simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper. Serve hot.
