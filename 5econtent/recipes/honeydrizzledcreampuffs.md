## Honey-Drizzled Cream Puffs

**Makes** 12 cream puffs

#### Puffs

1 egg, separated, plus 2 whole eggs

1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

⅓ cup water

3 tablespoons whole milk

5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into several pieces

1½ tablespoons sugar

½ teaspoon kosher salt

⅔ cup all-purpose flour, sifted

#### Filling

1⅓ cups heavy cream, cold

3 tablespoons honey

⅓ cup crème fraîche, cold

¾ teaspoon pure vanilla extract

To enhance both the flavor and stability of the filling, add crème fraîche to the whipped cream.

***Make the Puffs.*** Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick (silicone) baking mat.

In a small bowl, beat the separated egg yolk with 1 teaspoon water and set aside. In a second small bowl, beat the separated egg white with the remaining two whole eggs and the vanilla and set aside.

In a saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the water, milk, butter, sugar, and salt and cook, stirring, until the butter has melted and the mixture is on the verge of boiling, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the flour all at once, and, with a wooden spoon, beat the mixture until a cohesive ball forms. Return the pan to medium-low heat and continue beating the dough, using a smearing motion, for 3 minutes, until the dough is very smooth and slightly drier.

Scrape the dough into a food processor and, with the feed tube open, process for about 10 seconds to cool it slightly. With the motor running, slowly pour in the beaten eggs through the feed tube and process until they are absorbed, about 10 seconds. Stop and scrape down the sides of the food processor bowl, then continue processing until the paste becomes thick, smooth, and sticky, about 15 seconds more.

Scrape the paste into a large plastic bag and, using your hands or a bench scraper, push it into one lower corner of the bag. Cut off ½ inch from the very corner of the bag and pipe the paste onto the prepared baking sheet in 2-inch mounds, leaving at least a ½-inch space around each one.

Dip a spoon into cold water and use the back of the spoon to even out the shape and smooth the surface of the mounds. Using a pastry brush, brush each mound with a small portion of the reserved egg yolk mixture.

Bake for 15 minutes, then adjust the oven temperature to 375°F and continue baking until golden brown and firm, 7 to 9 minutes more.

Remove the puffs from the oven and, with the tip of a paring knife, cut a ¾-inch slit into the side of each puff to release steam. Turn off the oven, place the puffs on the baking sheet, return to the oven, prop the door open with a wooden spoon, and allow the puffs to dry, until the centers are barely moist and the exteriors are crisp, about 40 minutes. Transfer the puffs to a wire rack to cool to room temperature.

***To Make the Filling.*** with a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, a handheld electric mixer, or a whisk, beat the cream until it is softly whipped, adding the honey once the cream has thickened. Add the crème fraîche and vanilla and continue to beat until the mixture holds very stiff peaks.

Just before serving, cut the puffs in half. Fill each bottom half with about ¼ cup of the filling, position the top halves on the filling, arrange on a serving platter, drizzle with honey, and serve.
