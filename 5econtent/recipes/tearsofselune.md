## Tears of Selûne

**Serves** 4

3/10 cup mirin

3 tablespoons sake

3 tablespoons soy sauce

2 tablespoons granulated sugar

1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional)

1½ pounds firm white fish fillets (such as sea bass), cut into roughly 1-inch cubes

2 tablespoons neutral oil

Hot freshly cooked rice for serving

1 large scallion (white and light green parts), thinly sliced

1 tablespoon sesame seeds, lightly toasted (see Cook's Note, this page) and cooled

In a medium skillet over medium heat, combine the mirin, sake, soy sauce, sugar, and paprika (if using) and bring to a steamy simmer, swirling the skillet to dissolve the sugar. Once a few bubbles form around the edges, continue simmering, swirling the pan occasionally, until tight, glossy, foamy bubbles cover most of the surface, about 5½ minutes. Remove from the heat and let the mixture cool until just warm and thickened to the consistency of a loose glaze, 5 to 6 minutes.

Preheat the grill to medium-high.

Thread the cubed fish onto metal or pre-soaked bamboo skewers. Drizzle with oil and gently turn to coat. Once the grill is hot, cook the fish skewers until cooked through and lightly charred, 6 to 8 minutes, turning them over halfway through cooking. Just before removing the fish from the grill, gently brush it all over with the glaze.

Spoon a portion of rice onto each of four serving plates or bowls. Arrange the fish skewers over the rice, then sprinkle each portion with the scallions and sesame seeds. Serve immediately.
