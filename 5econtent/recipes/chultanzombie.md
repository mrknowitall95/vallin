**Serves** 2

Roughly cracked or small ice cubes

5 ounces amber or dark rum

4 ounces fresh pineapple juice

2 ounces fresh orange juice

1½ ounces grenadine

1 ounce fresh lime juice

½ ounce Cointreau or Grand Marnier

4 dashes Angostura bitters

3 ounces seltzer, cold (optional)

2 orange slices, pineapple chunks, and/or maraschino cherries for garnish

If you don't have any Cointreau to add sweetness and flavor, you can substitute 1½ teaspoons superfine sugar to each drink. To make superfine sugar, simply spin regular granulated sugar in the blender or food processor to break down the crystal size, which will allow it to dissolve in liquid more readily.

This is a high-volume drink, and cocktail shakers vary in size; so you may have to prepare the cocktails one at a time. Boston shakers, the type used in most bars, are larger than cobbler shakers with built-in strainers, which are common for home use.

Fill a cocktail shaker about halfway with ice and add the rum, pineapple juice, orange juice, grenadine, lime juice, Cointreau, and bitters. Cover and shake to blend and chill, 30 seconds. Fill two chilled Collins or highball glasses about halfway with ice. Strain half the mixture into each. If using, add 1½ ounces seltzer to each glass and stir gently. Garnish each cocktail as desired and serve at once.
