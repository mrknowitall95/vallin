## Beer Bread

**Serves** 2

3 cups all-purpose flour

1½ tablespoons granulated sugar

1 tablespoon baking powder

1 teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

One 12-ounce bottle ale (preferably an IPA), or another style of beer (see Cook's Note)

3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

Different types of beer produce different flavors in this bread. For instance, India pale ale (IPA) provides a noticeably pleasant beer flavor, whereas American-style lagers are so mild they can be difficult to detect. Dark beers such as porter or stout provide a richer flavor along with a bit of residual bitterness.

Beer bread is sensational with soups, as a snack on its own, or as a sponge to soak up the gravied jus of roasted game. Just don't expect it to last long once it's out of the oven.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 375°F. Coat a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and pepper and whisk to incorporate. Add the beer and, using a flexible spatula, stir to form a lumpy batter (do not overmix). Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it into the corners, if necessary. Pour about 2 tablespoons of the melted butter evenly over the batter.

Bake the bread until deep golden brown and a skewer inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 55 minutes, rotating the pan and brushing the top of the loaf with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter halfway through. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool for about 10 minutes. Remove the loaf from the pan, and let cool on the rack for 20 minutes longer. Slice the bread with a serrated knife and serve barely warm or at room temperature.
