## Black Pudding

**Serves** 4

⅔ cup packed light brown sugar

¼ cup instant espresso powder

3 tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa powder

3 tablespoons cornstarch

½ teaspoon kosher salt

3 egg yolks

¾ cup heavy cream

2¾ cups whole milk

¼ cup unsalted butter

1½ teaspoons pure vanilla extract

1 tablespoon coffee liqueur, such as Kahlua

2 teaspoons brandy or cognac

Chocolate shavings for serving

Very lightly sweetened whipped cream for serving (optional)

Avoid substituting the Dutch-processed cocoa powder here, because it's darker than natural cocoa and has a distinct flavor. You will be able to taste the cocoa in the pudding, but the espresso will be the dominant flavor.

In a heavy saucepan, whisk together the brown sugar, espresso powder, cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt, breaking up any brown sugar lumps as you go. Add the egg yolks and cream and whisk, reaching into the corners of the pan, until the mixture is smooth and uniform. Add the milk and whisk until incorporated.

Set the pan over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly and reaching into the corners of the pan, until the mixture is thickened and bubbling across its surface, 8 to 10 minutes. Continue cooking for about 1 minute more. Remove from the heat; add the butter, vanilla, coffee liqueur, and brandy; and whisk to melt and incorporate the butter fully.

Set a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl. Pour in the pudding and, with a flexible spatula, fold and stir the pudding gently to work it through the strainer. With a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap, cover the pudding, pressing the paper or wrap directly onto the pudding surface.

Refrigerate until cold and set, at least 4 or up to 12 hours. At serving time, stir the pudding gently until smooth and then top with chocolate shavings and whipped cream, if using.
