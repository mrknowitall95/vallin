## Sembian Honey-Glazed Rothé Ribs

**Serves** 4

½ cup ketchup

½ cup honey

1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

1 tablespoon cider vinegar

2 teaspoons Dijon mustard

1 tablespoon neutral-tasting oil, such as vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed

1 yellow onion, finely grated

Kosher salt

5 garlic cloves, finely chopped

2 teaspoons chili powder

1 teaspoon smoked paprika

Pinch of cayenne

4½ to 5 pounds baby back ribs, membranes removed, if desired (see Cook's Note)

Freshly ground black pepper

2 scallions, white and light green parts, thinly sliced, for garnish

On the bone (concave) side of the ribs there is a thin membrane that some people prefer to remove. To do so, slit the corner of the membrane with the tip of a paring knife to loosen it. Grab the loose corner with a paper towel (to improve your grip) and pull it up and off. If it doesn't come off in a single sheet, use the paper-towel trick to help pull off the remaining portion.

Preheat the oven to 325°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack in the sheet.

In a small bowl, whisk together the ketchup, honey, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and mustard until well-blended. Set aside.

In a nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm the oil until shimmering. Add the onion and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the onion appears drier, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic, chili powder, smoked paprika, and cayenne and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the ketchup mixture and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly. Continue to simmer, stirring, until the sauce has thickened slightly and the flavors have blended, about 5 minutes. Set aside off the heat to cool briefly; the mixture will thicken as it cools.

Sprinkle both sides of the ribs generously with salt and pepper. Brush about ⅓ cup of the sauce on the bone side, turn the ribs bone-side down, and brush the meaty sides with about ⅔ cup of the remaining sauce. Keeping the ribs bone-side down, roast until the meat is extremely tender (a paring knife should slip easily into the meat) and the meat between the bones in the middle of the racks registers about 205°F on an instant-read thermometer, 2½ to 3 hours; check after 2 hours and cover with foil if the top is getting too dark.

Adjust the oven temperature to 425°F. Brush the remaining ¼ cup sauce on the exposed (meaty) sides of the racks and continue to roast until the sauce heats through but remains sticky, 8 to 10 minutes.

Transfer the ribs to a cutting board and cut as desired. Transfer the cut ribs to a platter, sprinkle with the scallions, and serve hot.
