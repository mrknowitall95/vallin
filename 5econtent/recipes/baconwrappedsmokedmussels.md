## Bacon-Wrapped Smoked Mussels

**Serves** 4 as a snack

6 slices bacon

24 highest-quality smoked mussels (see Cook's Note)

Plump, high-quality mussels are imperative here—it's not worth making the recipe with tinned smoked mussels. Source the mussels from a small producer such as Ducktrap River of Maine, a smokehouse, or a fishmonger that sells smoked fish.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a plate with paper towels and set aside. Place a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet and set aside.

In a medium nonstick skillet over medium-low heat, cook the bacon until it begins to render some fat, is softened, and is half cooked, about 8 minutes, flipping the pieces halfway through. Transfer the bacon to the prepared plate to drain briefly.

Move the bacon to a cutting board, setting the plate aside. Cut the slices in half crosswise. Lay two mussels on a half slice of bacon, wrap the bacon around them, and secure with a toothpick. Repeat with the remaining mussels and bacon. Arrange the bundles on the prepared wire rack about 1 inch apart.

Place the baking sheet in the oven and roast the mussels until browned and starting to crisp, about 8 minutes. Transfer to the plate and let rest for 1 minute. Serve immediately; these should be eaten hot and fresh.
