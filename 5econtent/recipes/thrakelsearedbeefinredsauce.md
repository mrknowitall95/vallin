## Thrakel-Seared Beef in Red Sauce

**Serves** 4

1 pound flank steak, trimmed of fat

2 tablespoons Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry

1 tablespoon soy sauce

2½ teaspoons cornstarch

½ teaspoon granulated sugar

2 tablespoons low-sodium chicken broth or water

2 teaspoons unseasoned rice vinegar

2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil

3 tablespoons ketchup

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger

1 tablespoon pressed or grated garlic

6 scallions, trimmed, white parts minced and green parts cut into ½-inch pieces

3 tablespoons neutral oil

1 pound plum tomatoes, cored, halved lengthwise, seeded, and halves cut lengthwise into thirds (see Cook's Note)

1 medium yellow onion, halved from pole to pole and sliced lengthwise

You can substitute one 14 ½-ounce can diced tomatoes, drained, for the plum tomatoes, and use 2 tablespoons of their liquid instead of the broth.

Serve this with hot freshly cooked rice—brown or white.

Cut the flank steak against the grain into ½-inch-thick slices, each strip cut crosswise into thirds.

In a medium bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of the rice wine, the soy sauce, 2 teaspoons of the cornstarch, and the sugar and whisk to blend. Add the beef, stir to coat, and let rest at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the remaining 1 tablespoon rice wine, remaining ½ teaspoon cornstarch, the chicken broth, rice vinegar, and sesame oil and stir to blend. Add the ketchup, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper; mix until well blended; and set aside. In another small bowl, combine the ginger, garlic, scallion whites, and 2 teaspoons of the neutral oil; stir to mix; and set aside.

In a large nonstick skillet over high heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil until shimmering. Swirl the skillet to coat the bottom with oil, add half the beef in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned on the bottom, about 1 minute. Flip the beef, continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until brown on both sides, about 1 minute longer. Transfer to a large bowl, and set aside. Add another 1 tablespoon neutral oil to the skillet and repeat to cook the remaining beef. Transfer to the bowl.

Adjust the heat to medium-high, add the remaining 1 teaspoon of neutral oil to the skillet, and warm until shimmering. Swirl the skillet to coat the bottom with oil, add the tomatoes, toss to coat, and arrange in a single layer. Cook, undisturbed, until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Transfer half the tomatoes to the bowl with the beef. Add the onion to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 1½ minutes. Add the scallion greens and cook, stirring occasionally, until they start to wilt, about 1½ minutes longer. Adjust the heat to medium, clear the center of the pan, add the ginger-garlic mixture, and cook, stirring and mashing, until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Whisk the ketchup mixture to recombine, add to the skillet, and cook, stirring constantly until thickened, about 45 seconds. Return the beef and cooked tomatoes to the pan and cook, stirring constantly, until heated through and coated with sauce, about 1 minute longer. Serve immediately.
