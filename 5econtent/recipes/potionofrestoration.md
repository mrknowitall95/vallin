## Potion of Restoration

**Serves** 2

15 large blackberries

1 tablespoon sugar

1½ ounces fresh lemon juice

3 ounces gin

½ teaspoon butterfly pea powder (optional)

Roughly cracked or small ice cubes

1 ounce crème de mure (blackberry liqueur)

2 lemon zest twists for garnish

The drinks have a purple hue from the muddled blackberries, but to make the color extra vibrant, use the butterfly pea powder, which creates a vivid magenta color in the presence of an acid, such as lemon juice. Butterfly pea powder is available online and at some natural foods stores with a good selection of herbs and spices.

Crème de mure is a blackberry liqueur. If you can't find it, crème de cassis, a black currant liqueur, is a fine substitute.

In a cocktail shaker, muddle together 11 of the blackberries, the sugar, and lemon juice until the sugar dissolves fully. Add the gin and butterfly pea powder (if using). Fill the shaker about halfway with ice. Cover and shake to blend and chill, 30 seconds. Fill two chilled old-fashion or rocks glasses about halfway with ice and strain half the mixture into each, then pour ½ ounce crème de mure over the ice in each. Run one lemon twist around the rim of each glass and drop it in; add two of the remaining blackberries to each glass and serve at once.
