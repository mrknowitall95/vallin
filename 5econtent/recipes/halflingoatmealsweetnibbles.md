## Halfling Oatmeal Sweet Nibbles

**Makes** about 45 cookies

1½ cups all-purpose flour

2 cups rolled oats

1 teaspoon baking soda

½ teaspoon kosher salt

1½ cups packed light brown sugar

1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature

1 egg, beaten

2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract

1 cup semisweet chocolate chips

1 cup butterscotch chips

Smaller cookies will affect the cook time and later batches will cook noticeably faster if you are using the same baking sheet. For softer cookies, try cutting the cook time by a quarter.

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick (silicone) liners.

In a bowl, stir together the flour, oats, baking soda, and salt.

In a large bowl, beat together the brown sugar and butter until light and creamy. Mix in the egg and vanilla. Add the flour mixture and stir until incorporated. Stir in the chocolate chips and butterscotch chips.

Scoop the dough by the rounded tablespoon and place about 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. You'll need to bake a second batch of cookies because they won't all fit on the two baking sheets. (It's okay to reuse the parchment paper.)

Bake for 15 minutes, rotating the positions of the baking sheets halfway through, until the cookies are golden brown and a little darker around the edges. Let cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining dough. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.
