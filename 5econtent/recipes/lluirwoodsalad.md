## Lluirwood Salad

**Serves** 4

2½ teaspoons sherry vinegar

1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice

¾ teaspoon Dijon mustard

2 tablespoons minced shallot

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil

8 cups packed fresh baby spinach leaves (about 4½ ounces)

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 (4- to 5-ounce) log fresh goat cheese, crumbled

⅔ cup candied or spiced pecans or other nuts, chopped or broken into pieces

½ cup dried cranberries

To make the vinaigrette, in a large salad bowl, whisk together the vinegar, lemon juice, mustard, shallot, ½ teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Vigorously whisk in the olive oil to blend. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Reserve 1½ tablespoons.

Add the spinach to the bowl and toss to coat. Add ¼ teaspoon salt, pepper to taste, the goat cheese, most of the nuts, and most of the cranberries; toss to combine. Sprinkle with the remaining nuts and cranberries, drizzle with the reserved 1½ tablespoons vinaigrette, and serve.
