## Melted Cheeses with Chunky Tomato Broth

**Serves** 4

#### Tomato Broth

2 tablespoons salted butter

1 large onion, finely chopped

1 bay leaf

Kosher salt

1 tablespoon light brown sugar

1 tablespoon tomato paste

4 cups low-sodium chicken broth

2 tablespoons long-grain white rice

1 (28-ounce) can peeled whole tomatoes

Freshly ground black pepper

#### Melted Cheese Sandwiches

6 tablespoons salted butter, softened

8 (½-inch-thick) slices white or multigrain French, Italian, or sandwich bread

8 ounces firm or semifirm cheese (such as a young Cheddar, Colby, Monterey Jack, Fontina, Havarti, Gouda, or Baby Swiss), coarsely grated

1½ tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, dill, or chives for garnish

***Make the Soup.*** In a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the onion, bay leaf, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and light golden, about 5 minutes. Add the brown sugar and tomato paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the chicken broth and rice. Reserve three tomatoes and add the remainder with the juices, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring to a simmer. Adjust the heat to medium-low, cover, and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the rice is very tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the bay leaf.

In a countertop blender, or with an immersion blender, puree the tomato mixture until smooth; return the pureed mixture to the pot. Chop the reserved tomatoes, add to the soup, and stir. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, if necessary, and pepper. Cover and keep warm over very low heat.

***To Make the Melted Cheese Sandwiches.*** set a large nonstick or cast-iron griddle over medium-low heat.

Spread about 2 teaspoons of the softened butter on one side of four slices of the bread, all the way to the edges. Place them on the work surface buttered-sides down. Top each slice with about ½ cup of grated cheese. Spread the remaining softened butter on one side of each of the remaining four slices of bread. Place them on the sandwiches buttered-sides up. Transfer the sandwiches to the griddle or skillet and cook until golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes on each side. Transfer the sandwiches to a cutting board and cut crosswise into four or five strips.

Serve the tomato broth and melted cheeses together, sprinkling each bowl of broth with the chopped herbs.
