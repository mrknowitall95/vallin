## Quij's Plate

**Serves** 4

3 tablespoons neutral oil

1 pound fresh sausage (your choice of flavor), casings removed

2 pounds red or all-purpose potatoes, cut into ½-inch cubes

Kosher salt

⅓ cup water

2 medium yellow onions, chopped

1 large red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and chopped

1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage, or 2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme or rosemary

1½ teaspoons pressed or grated garlic

¼ cup half-and-half

Freshly ground black pepper

½ cup chopped fresh parsley

4 eggs

In a large skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium heat, warm 1 tablespoon of the neutral oil until shimmering. Add the sausage and cook, stirring and breaking it into small pieces, until it no longer appears raw, 3 to 4 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the sausage to a bowl or plate, leaving behind the rendered fat.

In the same skillet over medium heat, warm the remaining 2 tablespoons neutral oil with the sausage fat until shimmering. Add the potatoes and ¼ teaspoon salt and stir to coat the potatoes with the oil and fat. Add the water, cover, and cook until the potatoes are just tender, 12 to 14 minutes. Uncover the skillet; add the onions, bell pepper, and ½ teaspoon salt; and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and light golden, about 8 minutes. Add the sage and garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the half-and-half, 1 teaspoon salt, and black pepper to taste, stirring until well blended. Pat the mixture flat in the pan, adjust the heat to medium-high, and cook, undisturbed, until the visible moisture evaporates, there is no more visible bubbling on the surface, and the bottom begins to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Using a wooden spoon or a stiff spatula, stir the mixture, scraping the brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Return the sausage to the pan and add most of the parsley, stirring to blend. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

Using the back of a spoon, make an indentation for each egg, crack an egg into each, and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Cover the skillet, adjust the heat to medium, and cook until the egg whites are set and the yolks are warm and slightly thickened but still liquid, 6 to 9 minutes, depending on how firm you like your eggs. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley before serving.
