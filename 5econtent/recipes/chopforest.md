**Serves** 4 to 6

1 pound green cabbage, finely shredded

Kosher salt

¼ cup Kalamata olives, pitted and finely chopped

1 tablespoon white balsamic vinegar

1½ teaspoons finely grated lemon zest

1 teaspoon pressed or grated garlic

Freshly ground black pepper

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

1 medium fennel bulb, trimmed, cored, and thinly sliced, plus about 1½ tablespoons chopped fronds

4 medium scallions, trimmed; whites thinly sliced and greens cut into ½-inch lengths

⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley

You can substitute thinly shaved fresh brussels sprouts for some or all of the cabbage if you'd like. It will decrease the yield a bit, as brussels sprouts leaves are more delicate than cabbage, and they compact more once dressed. If you use shaved brussels sprouts, there's no need to salt and rest them.

In a colander or large strainer set over a medium bowl, toss the cabbage with 2 teaspoons salt. Let the cabbage rest until slightly wilted, at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours. Rinse the cabbage well under very cold running water, drain thoroughly, and dry very well with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Scrape the cabbage into a large bowl and fluff it with your fingers (it can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days).

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the olives, vinegar, lemon zest, garlic, and ½ teaspoon salt; season with pepper; and whisk to incorporate. While whisking vigorously, add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream to combine and emulsify into a dressing.

Add the cabbage, fennel bulb, scallions, and parsley to the bowl and toss to combine. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary, and sprinkle with the fennel fronds before serving.
