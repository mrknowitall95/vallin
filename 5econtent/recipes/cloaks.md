## Cloaks

**Makes** about 20 cloaks

1½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks

5 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small cubes, at room temperature

1¼ cups half-and-half

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 pinch freshly ground nutmeg

1 pinch cayenne pepper

1 egg plus 2 egg yolks, beaten

½ teaspoon baking powder

If you don't have a pastry bag, you can get away with a heavy-duty ziplock freezer bag as a substitute. Snip off about ⅜ inch from a bottom corner and fit the star tip into the hole, pushing it through from inside the bag.

Although you'll sacrifice the crisp ridges created by the star tip, you can use a spoon to shape the mounds into circles or ovals of about the same dimensions as the piped version, and run the tines of a fork over the surface to add texture.

Place the potatoes in a large microwave-safe bowl, cover with a microwave-safe lid or plate, and microwave until very tender, about 18 minutes, stirring the potatoes twice during that time. Spread the potatoes on a baking sheet or large plate and let cool until you can handle them, about 5 minutes. Set a potato ricer over the empty bowl and rice the potatoes into it. Add half the butter cubes and stir to incorporate. Add the half-and-half, 2 teaspoons salt, ¾ teaspoon pepper, the nutmeg, and cayenne and stir to incorporate. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Add the egg and yolks and baking powder and stir until the mixture is uniform and very smooth. Let cool to room temperature, add the remaining butter cubes, and fold to incorporate.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 475°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat and coat it lightly with nonstick cooking spray.

Scrape the potato mixture into a piping bag fitted with a ½-inch star tip. Hold the filled pastry bag slightly above the prepared baking sheet and apply steady, gentle, downward pressure to pipe a mound roughly 2 inches in diameter and 2 inches high. Work your way out in a tight circular motion, and then back in again to build height. Pipe twenty mounds total, with about 1 inch between them (five rows of four mounds). Lightly coat the mounds with cooking spray.

Bake the cloaks until golden brown, about 14 minutes, rotating the baking sheet about halfway through. Let cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes, then, using a spatula, transfer to a serving platter. Serve immediately.
