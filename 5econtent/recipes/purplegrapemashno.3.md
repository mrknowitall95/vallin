## Purple Grapemash No. 3

**Serves** 2

4 ounces white or amber rum

1 ounce fresh lime juice, plus 2 lime slices

½ cup grape jelly

2 cups small ice cubes

To chill a sturdy wine glass, put it in the freezer for an hour before using.

Chill two sturdy wine glasses, stemmed or not, or margarita glasses.

In a blender, combine the rum, lime juice, grape jelly, and ice cubes and blend until the ice is finely crushed and the mixture is uniform, slushy, and moves easily in the blender jar (the timing will depend on the power of your blender). Divide the mixture between the prepared glasses, garnish each with a lime slice, and serve immediately, with straws, if desired.
