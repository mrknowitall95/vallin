## Sensate Palate Cleanser

**Makes** about 2 quarts

1 tablespoon unsalted butter

1 medium leek (white and light green parts), chopped

Kosher salt

3 medium-small English cucumbers

3 cups low-sodium chicken broth

⅔ cup half-and-half

1½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice

Freshly ground black pepper

3 tablespoons snipped fresh chives

In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the leek and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the leek begins to soften, about 2½ minutes. Adjust the heat to medium-low, cover, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the leek has released its juices, about 5 minutes longer. Remove from the heat and let cool briefly.

Meanwhile, peel one of the cucumbers, leaving about one-fourth of the skin on for a little texture and color. Peel the other two cucumbers completely. Halve all the cucumbers lengthwise and remove the seeds. Finely dice one of the fully peeled halves and set aside. Cut the remaining five halves into roughly 1-inch pieces.

In a blender, combine one-third of the roughly chopped cucumbers, one-third of the leek, and 1 cup of the chicken broth and puree until very smooth, about 40 seconds. Pour the mixture into a large bowl (preferably stainless steel) and set aside. Repeat to blend another third of the cucumbers, leeks, and broth, pouring this batch into the bowl with the first one. For the last batch, combine the remaining roughly chopped cucumber, remaining leeks, and remaining 1 cup chicken broth in the blender; add the half-and-half; and puree. Add to the bowl, stir in the lemon juice and ¾ teaspoon salt, and season with pepper. Stir in the diced cucumber. Cover and refrigerate until cold, about 4 hours.

When ready to serve, stir the soup to blend again, and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Ladle into individual bowls and garnish each with a sprinkle of pepper and some chives.
