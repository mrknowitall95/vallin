## Neverwinter Nectar

**Makes** about 1¾ quarts

2 large juicy oranges, scrubbed

1 large juicy lemon, scrubbed

3 tablespoons granulated sugar

1 cup apple juice

½ cup brandy

One 750 ml bottle inexpensive white wine, chilled (not oaked; see Cook's Note)

1 apple, washed well

1 cup seltzer, cold

1 cup small ice cubes, plus more for serving

Good choices for the white wine include dry Riesling, Gewürztraminer, Grüner Veltliner, Pinot Grigio (or Gris), or Sauvignon Blanc. Wines with oaky notes aren't great here, so steer clear of Chardonnay, which may or may not be oaked.

Quarter one of the oranges and the lemon, cutting them from the stem end to the blossom end. Cut the quarters crosswise into thin slices and place in a sturdy container. Add the sugar, stir, and set aside until the fruit softens a little, about 20 minutes. Using a potato masher, muddler, or wooden spoon, mash and muddle the mixture until the fruit releases its juice, the skins are bruised, and the juices and sugar become syrupy. Add the apple juice, brandy, and wine; stir; then cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.

Set a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl. Strain the mixture, using a sturdy spoon to press on and work the solids to exude as much liquid as possible. Discard or compost the solids and pour the liquid into a serving pitcher. Quarter the remaining orange, again cutting from the stem end to the blossom end, and thinly slice the quarters crosswise. Add to the pitcher. Quarter and core the apple, and thinly slice the quarters crosswise. Add to the pitcher, along with the seltzer and ice cubes and stir to blend. Serve over ice.
