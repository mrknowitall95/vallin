## Gurdats

**Serves** 4 to 6

4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

½ teaspoon fresh lemon juice

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

24 large cremini or white button mushrooms, stems finely chopped, caps left whole

5 garlic cloves, finely chopped

⅔ cup breadcrumbs

½ cup finely chopped fresh parsley

1 shallot, minced

1½ teaspoons minced fresh thyme

¼ cup dry sherry, such as Amontillado

¾ cup finely chopped hot Peppadew peppers (see Cook's Note)

¾ cup coarsely grated Parmesan cheese

3 tablespoons cream cheese, softened

With their fruity, tangy, sweet, and spicy flavor notes, Peppadew peppers (a type of pickled pepper, sold in jars) can be found either hot or mild; the hot variety is preferred here. Blot them dry with paper towels before chopping them.

Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil, set a wire rack in the baking sheet, and coat it with nonstick cooking spray.

In a very large bowl, vigorously whisk together 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, the lemon juice, ½ teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper. Add the mushroom caps and toss gently to coat. Arrange them gill-sides up on the rack and roast until they shrink slightly and fill with liquid, 15 to 18 minutes. Pour off the liquid from the caps, turn them over, and continue roasting until browned and tender, 6 to 10 minutes more. Remove them from the oven and set aside, but leave the oven on.

Meanwhile, in a bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon olive oil, half the garlic, ½ teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper. Add the breadcrumbs and 2 tablespoons of the parsley, toss until the crumbs are lightly moistened, and set aside.

In a skillet over medium heat, warm the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil until shimmering. Add the chopped mushroom stems, shallot, thyme, and ½ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring until the mixture is softened and browned, about 8 minutes. Add the remaining garlic and cook, stirring until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the sherry and stir, to cook off the alcohol and thicken the mixture slightly, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape the mixture into a bowl and let cool to room temperature.

Add ⅓ cup of the breadcrumb mixture, the remaining parsley, the Peppadews, Parmesan, cream cheese, ¼ teaspoon salt, and a few grinds of pepper to the bowl and mix until uniform. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

Turn the mushroom caps gill-side up and scoop a generous 1 tablespoon of filling into each. Dip the mushrooms filled-side down in the remaining breadcrumb mixture to coat the filling and arrange on the rack. Roast until the filling is hot and the crumb topping is crisp and light golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve hot.
