## Moonshae Seafood Rice

**Serves** 4

4 cups fish or seafood stock

¼ teaspoon crushed saffron threads

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

1 onion, finely chopped

Kosher salt

1½ cups Arborio rice

¾ cup dry white wine, at room temperature

12 ounces shelled, deveined extra-large shrimp (21 to 25 shrimp per pound), halved lengthwise

12 ounces dry sea scallops, halved lengthwise

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

3 tablespoons minced chives for garnish

The exact volume of liquid required for the rice to fully cook can vary. Occasionally, the quantity falls a bit short of the 4 cups in the recipe, but sometimes it takes the full amount.

Note that you have to keep the broth warm while you prepare the rice.

In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring the stock to a simmer. Adjust the heat to low and keep warm. In a small bowl, mix together about ½ cup of the warm stock and the saffron, stirring until the liquid is tinted, and set aside.

In a large saucepan over medium heat, warm the oil until shimmering. Add the onion and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the rice and cook, stirring constantly, until the edges of the grains begin to turn translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the wine, adjust the heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring frequently, until the wine is absorbed into the rice, about 2 minutes. Add 1 cup of the warm stock and cook, stirring frequently, until it is absorbed into the rice, about 5 minutes. Repeat the process twice more, adding 1 cup stock each time.

Sprinkle the shrimp and scallops lightly with salt, add them to the rice, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Add the reserved saffron-stock and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until it is absorbed and the rice is fragrant and tinted and appears moist and creamy, about 3 minutes more. The rice grains should be al dente—cooked through, but still with a touch of resistance to the bite—and the shrimp and scallops should be just cooked through and opaque. Add the butter and stir to melt and incorporate. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt. Adjust the consistency with additional stock, if necessary, stirring until it is incorporated. Serve hot, sprinkling each portion with some of the chives.
