## Par-Salian's Tea

**Serves** 4

1 lemon

2½-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled if desired

5 cups boiling water

Honey as needed

4 sprigs fresh mint

Peeling the ginger isn't strictly necessary.

The ginger and lemon zest will continue to infuse the liquid as you drink. For the strongest flavor, leave them in the mug until you finish; remove them at any point when you find the flavor sufficiently potent.

Using a vegetable peeler and working vertically, remove the zest from the lemon in wide strips (it should produce eight strips). Slice the ginger into four pieces, each about ½ inch thick, and working with one slice at a time, use the bottom of a sturdy mug or the flat side of a chef's knife to smash them. Place two lemon zest strips and one piece of smashed ginger in each of four mugs. Add about 1¼ cups boiling water to each mug and steep until fragrant, about 4 minutes. Add honey to taste to each mug and stir to combine. Holding the mint sprigs by their stems, slap them against the back of your hand or forearm (to help release their fragrance). Add one sprig to each mug and serve.
