## Potato Leek Soup

**Serves** 6

2 slices thick-cut bacon

3 leeks, white and light green parts, thinly sliced

3 celery stalks, chopped

2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves

2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces

4 cups low-sodium chicken broth

Kosher salt

1 cup heavy cream

Freshly ground black pepper

In a large heavy pot over medium heat, fry the bacon, turning it over as necessary, until well-rendered and lightly browned, about 13 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or tongs to transfer the bacon to a paper towel.

Add the leeks, celery, and thyme to the pot and cook, stirring, until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Add the potatoes, broth, and 1 teaspoon salt. Simmer until the potatoes are soft, 15 to 20 minutes.

Remove the soup from the heat. Using an immersion blender, blend until smooth. Alternatively, blend the soup in batches using a countertop blender.

Return the soup to the pot over medium heat. Stir in the cream and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Taste and season with black pepper and more salt, if needed. Crumble the cooked bacon. Serve each bowl of soup piping hot and topped with bacon (alternatively, the soup can be served cold).
