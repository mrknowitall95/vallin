## Twice-Baked Cockatrice Wings

**Serves** 4

3½ pounds chicken wings, halved at the joints, wing tips removed

1 tablespoon baking powder

1½ teaspoons salt

1½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper

2½ tablespoons garam masala powder

The initial roasting at the lower oven temperature allows the fat to render, which aids in crisping the skin, as does the baking powder.

Preheat the oven to 300°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Set a wire rack in a large rimmed baking sheet.

In a large bowl, toss the chicken wings with the baking powder to coat. Add the salt and pepper and toss again to coat. Arrange the wings skin-side up on the wire rack and roast for 40 minutes. Adjust the heat to 425°F and continue to roast until the wings are golden brown and crisp, about 40 minutes more. Sprinkle the wings with the garam masala and continue to roast for 10 minutes more. Using tongs, carefully remove the wings from the rack. Serve hot.
