If you choose to serve the tavern steaks with bread, brioche buns or English muffins are excellent options, particularly if you grill them, cut-sides down, while the cooked tavern steaks rest.

***Make the Dill-Yogurt Sauce.*** In a small bowl, whisk together the yogurt, relish, shallot, dill, ½ teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Cover and refrigerate until needed.

***Make the Olive and Fig Sauce.*** In a bowl, cover the figs with 1 cup boiling water and set aside to soften, about 15 minutes. Reserving about ⅓ cup of the soaking water, drain the figs, dry, and finely chop.

In a food processor, combine the olives, capers, garlic, thyme, and lemon juice. Process until finely chopped. With the motor running, slowly add the olive oil. Stop to scrape down the sides of the work bowl and continue pulsing or processing to a desired consistency. Scrape the mixture into a bowl, add the figs, stir, and set aside to blend the flavors, about 15 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning by adding salt to taste; adjust the consistency by adding some of the reserved fig soaking liquid, about 1 tablespoon at a time, if necessary. Set the sauce and parsley aside at room temperature

***Make the Steaks.*** In a small skillet over medium heat, warm the oil until shimmering. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute.

In a large bowl, break up the ground lamb and beef into rough chunks. Add the onion mixture, 1½ teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and toss lightly with your hands to distribute the seasonings. Divide the mixture into four 6-ounce portions and, with a light hand, gently form them into patties roughly 4 inches in diameter and 1 inch thick. Press a divot into the top of each patty, if desired. Cover and refrigerate until you are ready to grill.

Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal grill or preheat a gas grill on high for 15 minutes. Clean and oil the grill grate. Grill the patties until grill-marked on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Flip the patties and continue grilling for 3 minutes, until the meat is medium-rare (125° to 130°F on an instant-read thermometer), or for about 6 minutes for medium (135° to 140°F), or for 9 to 10 minutes for well (155° to 160°F).

Transfer the patties to a plate, cover loosely with foil, and let rest for about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, stir the parsley into the olive-fig sauce. Serve the steaks hot with the sauces passed at the table.
