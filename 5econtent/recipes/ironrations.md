## Iron Rations

**Serves** 4

1¼ pounds semifirm or firm cheese, such as Manchego, Asiago Fresco, Gruyère, Comté, Jarlsberg, Gouda, Monterey Jack, or Cheddar, cut into bite-size cubes

10 ounces hard salami; cured sausage, such as hard chorizo, Calabrese, pepperoni, or sopressata; or beef or turkey jerky cut into bite-size pieces

12 pitted dates, dried figs, or dried apricots

1 cup roasted nuts, such as almonds, pecans, cashews, pistachios, or a mixture

4 handfuls wheat crackers

4 whole pieces fresh fruit, such as apples, pears, bananas, oranges, or 4 small bunches grapes

If combining in a container or bag, use dried beef or turkey jerky instead of salami to prevent the mix from becoming too moist due to the high fat content of the meat.

If dining in, divide the cheese, salami, dried fruit, nuts, crackers, and fresh fruit among four plates, and serve. Alternatively, if you're eating on the trail, combine all the ingredients in a large container or bag (or divide evenly among four individual containers) to take with you.
