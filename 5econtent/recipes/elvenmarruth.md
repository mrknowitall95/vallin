## Elven Marruth

**Makes** about 12 pastries

1 small yellow onion, finely chopped

1 small Yukon gold potato, peeled and cut into ½-inch pieces

2 carrots, peeled and finely chopped

2 cups packed finely chopped green cabbage

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh thyme, plus 1½ tablespoons picked whole thyme leaves

¾ teaspoon soy sauce

¼ cup chopped fresh dill

All-purpose flour for dusting

Pastry for 2 double-crust pies (about 1½ pounds), thawed if frozen

1 egg

Preheat the oven to 375°F with the racks in the upper-middle and lower-middle of the oven. Line two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick (silicone) liners.

In a bowl, combine the onion, potato, carrots, cabbage, and olive oil and toss to coat the vegetables with the oil. Add ½ teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper and toss to distribute. Transfer the mixture to one of the prepared baking sheets, spreading it into a thin, even layer (set the bowl aside).

Roast the vegetables on either rack until tender, 25 to 30 minutes, stirring and turning the vegetables two or three times. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, add the chopped thyme, and stir to incorporate it. Spread out the mixture and allow to cool to room temperature for about 20 minutes. Leave the oven on for more baking.

Return the cooled vegetables to the now-empty bowl. Stir in the soy sauce, dill, ¾ teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Adjust the seasoning, if necessary, and set aside until needed.

Replace the parchment paper on the baking sheet or wash the nonstick liner and return it to the baking sheet. Have a small bowl of water handy.

Dust a large sheet of parchment paper with flour. If you are working with homemade pie pastry, divide the dough into two balls. Working with one ball of homemade pastry, or one sheet of store-bought pastry, roll the dough into a 12-inch circle. Sprinkle half of the whole thyme leaves evenly over the pastry, cover with another sheet of parchment paper, and roll lightly to help the thyme stick. Flip the pastry over so the thyme leaves are on the bottom, and set aside. Repeat with the remaining pastry and remaining whole thyme leaves.

With a 4-inch round biscuit or cookie cutter, cut six circles out of each pastry round, patching together scraps if necessary, for a total of twelve circles. Working with six of the pastry circles, place about 1½ tablespoons of the vegetable mixture in the center of each round, leaving a ½-inch border around the edge. Working with one piece of pastry at a time, moisten the edge of the pastry circle and fold the pastry over the filling to make a half-moon shape. Press out any trapped air, press the edges firmly to seal, and, using a fork, crimp the edges for decoration and to secure the seal. Repeat with the remaining pastry rounds and filling, and transfer onto the prepared baking sheets.

In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush the top and sides of each marruth with the mixture. Bake until the marruths are light golden brown and crisp, about 25 minutes, rotating the sheets 180 degrees and switching racks halfway through the baking. Set the baking sheets on wire racks, cool the pastries for about 5 minutes, and serve hot.
