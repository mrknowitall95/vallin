## Kender Stumblenoodles

**Serves** 8

6 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1 tablespoon paprika

½ teaspoon garlic powder

1 pinch cayenne pepper

3 cups whole milk

2 teaspoons Dijon mustard

2 ounces cream cheese, cut into 4 pieces, at room temperature

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

4½ cups lightly packed, coarsely grated sharp or extra-sharp Cheddar cheese (see Cook's Note)

12 ounces fusilli or rotini

1½ cups lightly packed, coarsely grated Gruyère cheese (see Cook's Note)

1⅓ cups panko breadcrumbs

It's best to grate your own cheese for this, as opposed to using pre-grated, which can be a touch grainy when melted because it includes additives to prevent clumping.

In this recipe, there's a lot of liquid and a lot of vigorous whisking, so choose a large, deep pot that can help contain the inevitable splashes.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 375°F. Smear a shallow 13 by 9-inch baking dish with 2 tablespoons of the butter, set it on a baking sheet, and set aside.

Fill a large pot with water, set over high heat, and bring to a boil.

Meanwhile, in another large pot over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Whisk in the flour, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne and cook, scraping the bottom of the pot, for 1 minute. Whisking constantly (and taking care to reach into the corners of the pot), gradually add the milk. Bring the mixture to a strong simmer, whisking the liquid and scraping the bottom of the pan often. Adjust the heat to medium and continue simmering and whisking until the sauce is thickened to the consistency of half-and-half, about 8 minutes longer.

Remove the pot from the heat; add the mustard, cream cheese, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper; and whisk vigorously to melt and incorporate the cream cheese. Whisking constantly but gently, add the Cheddar, about 1 cup at a time, taking care to fully melt and incorporate each addition before adding the next. The sauce should be smooth and uniform.

Add 1 tablespoon salt and the fusilli to the pot of boiling water and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, according to the package directions until about 2 minutes short of al dente (there should be some resistance to the tooth). Drain the pasta, add it to the sauce, and stir to coat thoroughly. Let the mixture cool briefly, add the Gruyère, and stir to incorporate. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Scrape the mixture into the prepared baking dish and smooth into an even layer.

In a small microwave-safe bowl in the microwave oven, or in a small pot over medium heat, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Add the panko and ¼ teaspoon salt, season with pepper, and toss to coat the breadcrumbs. Sprinkle the panko evenly over the pasta.

Bake the pasta until heated through, the surface is browned, and the edges are bubbly, 30 to 40 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. Let rest briefly, 8 to 10 minutes, before serving.
