## Green Ice Rime

**Serves** 4

½ teaspoon neutral oil

4½ cups 1% or 2% milk

3 envelopes unflavored gelatin (2 tablespoons plus ¾ teaspoon)

⅓ cup granulated sugar

1 small pinch kosher salt

2 teaspoons mint extract

¼ teaspoon vanilla extract

3 small drops green food coloring

Glass or ceramic baking pans are your top choices here. Since you'll be cutting the gelatin right in the pan, you could easily damage the nonstick coating in a metal pan.

Using a paper towel, spread the neutral oil in an 8- or 9-inch square baking pan, coating the bottom and sides and leaving a slight film. Set aside.

Pour 1½ cups of the milk into a wide bowl, sprinkle the gelatin evenly over the surface, and allow to soften, about 10 minutes.

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm the remaining 3 cups milk, the sugar, and salt, stirring to dissolve the sugar, until warm to the touch, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat, add the gelatin mixture, and whisk until the gelatin dissolves. Let cool for about 10 minutes. Add the mint extract, vanilla, and food coloring and stir to incorporate. Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and refrigerate until firm, about 4 hours and no more than 2 days.

When ready to serve, cut the gelatin into 2-inch squares and transfer to chilled dessert goblets or sundae dishes.
