## Arkhan the Cruel's Flame-Roasted Halfling Chili

**Serves** 4 to 6

1½ tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder

1½ tablespoons chili powder

1¼ teaspoons ground cinnamon

1½ teaspoons dried oregano

¾ teaspoon ground cumin

½ teaspoon ground allspice

¼ teaspoon ground cloves

¼ teaspoon cayenne, or as needed

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 (15-ounce) cans red kidney beans, drained and rinsed

2 cups low-sodium chicken broth

4 slices bacon

1 large yellow onion, finely chopped

5 garlic cloves, finely chopped

1 (15-ounce) can tomato puree

2 teaspoons dark or light brown sugar

1 pound lean ground turkey

1 teaspoon cider vinegar

Oyster crackers, freshly cooked buttered noodles, grated Cheddar cheese, and/or finely chopped onion for serving (optional)

The cocoa powder contributes both flavor complexity and a dark hue to the chili, without making it taste of chocolate. The cayenne gives a bare tingle, but you can certainly add more if you like your chili spicy-hot.

In a small bowl, mix together the cocoa powder, chili powder, cinnamon, oregano, cumin, allspice, cloves, cayenne, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper. Set aside.

In a blender or food processor, puree half the kidney beans with about ¾ cup of the broth until smooth and set aside.

In a small Dutch oven over medium heat, fry the bacon, turning it over as necessary, until well-rendered and lightly browned, about 13 minutes. Transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain, chop it, and reserve.

Return the pot to medium heat, add the onion and a pinch of salt to the rendered bacon fat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and the reserved spice mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add the remaining 1¼ cups broth and bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen and dissolve any browned bits. Add the tomato puree, brown sugar, and pureed bean mixture and stir to incorporate. Add the ground turkey and break it into large chunks (it will break down more on its own). Add the remaining kidney beans and stir to mix. Adjust the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer; then adjust the heat to medium-low and simmer to blend flavors and thicken slightly, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally, about 30 minutes.

Add the vinegar and reserved bacon and stir. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve with oyster crackers or noodles, cheese, and onion, as desired.
