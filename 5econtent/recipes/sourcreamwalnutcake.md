## Sour Cream-Walnut Cake

**Makes** one 8-inch square cake

#### Topping

⅓ cup all-purpose flour

¼ cup granulated sugar

¼ cup packed light brown sugar

½ teaspoon ground cinnamon

¼ teaspoon kosher salt

⅔ cup walnut pieces, toasted lightly (see Cook's Note) and cooled

5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled

#### Cake

1 cup walnut pieces, toasted lightly and cooled

2 cups all-purpose flour

2½ teaspoons instant espresso powder

1½ teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon baking soda

¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon

1 teaspoon kosher salt

2 eggs

1 cup sour cream

½ cup neutral oil

1½ teaspoons vanilla extract

½ cup granulated sugar

⅔ cup packed light brown sugar

To toast nuts or seeds, warm a heavy skillet over medium heat until hot. Add the nuts or seeds and spread out in a single layer. Cook, stirring constantly, until they are fragrant and as brown as desired.

The cake can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 2 days.

***To make the topping:.*** In a food processor, combine the flour, both sugars, cinnamon, and salt. Scatter the walnuts on top and drizzle the melted butter over the mixture. Pulse until the mixture just begins to resemble a wet, coarse sand, about three 2-second pulses (do not overprocess and pulverize the nuts). Scrape the mixture onto a plate (no need to clean the work bowl, as you'll use it again) and refrigerate for 20 minutes.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 350°F. Coat an 8-inch square baking pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.

In the food processor, pulse the walnuts with ¼ cup of the flour until the walnuts are coarsely ground, about five 2-second pulses. Pour the walnut mixture into a medium bowl; add the remaining 1¾ cups flour, the espresso powder, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt; and whisk to combine.

In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until uniform. Add the sour cream, neutral oil, and vanilla and whisk vigorously to combine. Add both sugars and again whisk vigorously to combine. Add the flour mixture and, using a flexible spatula, fold to blend the wet and dry ingredients just until no pockets of dry ingredients remain. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, and smooth the top.

Working quickly, with your fingers, sprinkle the topping evenly over the surface, forming pea- to hazelnut-size clumps. Gently pat the topping onto the batter to help secure it.

Bake the cake until the top is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes, rotating the pan about halfway through. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature before cutting and serving.
