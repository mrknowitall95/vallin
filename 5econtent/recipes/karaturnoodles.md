## Kara-Tur Noodles

**Serves** 4

3 tablespoons soy sauce

2½ tablespoons Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry, such as Amontillado

1 tablespoon Asian sesame oil

1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into ½-inch strips

6 ounces dried rice stick noodles (¼ inch wide)

¼ cup plus 2 teaspoons peanut oil or vegetable, canola, safflower, or grapeseed oil

½ cup low-sodium chicken broth

1 teaspoon light brown sugar

½ teaspoon cornstarch

2-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped or grated (about 1½ tablespoons)

5 garlic cloves, finely chopped

¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 large yellow onion, halved lengthwise and thickly sliced into slivers

1 large red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into 1-inch squares

1 large celery stalk, cut diagonally into ¾-inch slices

6 scallions, whites thinly sliced and greens cut into 1-inch lengths

A large skillet is important to provide maximum cooking surface for food to spread out. If it is all heaped together, the food will steam instead of achieving the desired browning effect.

Shrimp can be substituted for the chicken. When doing so, buy extra-large (21 to 25 shrimp per pound), and be sure not to overcook them. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes initially, and add them to the vegetable and noodle mixture about halfway through the final heating time, after about 1 minute, so they are only in the mixture until just cooked and heated through, about 1 minute.

In a bowl, whisk together 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of the rice wine, and 1½ teaspoons of the sesame oil. Add the chicken, toss to coat, cover the bowl, and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes or up to 1 hour.

Meanwhile, put the noodles in a large bowl, cover with boiling water, and stir to separate the noodles. Soak until the noodles are almost tender, about 6 minutes, stirring once halfway through. Drain the noodles, rinse with cold water, and drain again. Return the noodles to the bowl, add 2 teaspoons of the peanut oil, and toss well to coat.

In a small bowl, make the sauce by mixing together the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce, remaining 1½ tablespoons rice wine, remaining 1½ teaspoons sesame oil, the broth, brown sugar, and cornstarch; set aside. In another small bowl, mix together the ginger, garlic, red pepper flakes, and 2 teaspoons of the peanut oil; set aside.

In a very large (14-inch) nonstick skillet over high heat, warm 2 teaspoons peanut oil until shimmering. Add half the chicken in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until the pieces brown on the bottom but are not quite cooked through, about 2 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a large bowl and set aside. Add another 2 teaspoons peanut oil to the skillet over high heat and warm until the oil is shimmering. Add the remaining chicken, cook as before, and transfer to the bowl when finished.

Add another 2 teaspoons peanut oil to the skillet over high heat and warm until the oil is shimmering. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pieces begin to soften and brown at the edges, 2 to 3 minutes; add it to the bowl with the chicken. Add another 2 teaspoons peanut oil to the skillet over high heat and warm until the oil is shimmering. Add the bell pepper and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are barely tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium, clear the center of the pan, add the remaining 2 teaspoons peanut oil, and allow it to warm until shimmering. Add the ginger-garlic mixture and cook, stirring and mashing it, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Whisk the soy sauce mixture to recombine, add it to the skillet, and cook, stirring and scraping the skillet constantly, until thickened, about 1 minute.

Add the chicken mixture, noodles, all of the scallion whites, and most of the scallion greens to the skillet and toss to combine. Cook, stirring constantly, until the noodles are heated through and coated with sauce, about 2 minutes.

Transfer the mixture to a serving platter, sprinkle with the remaining scallion greens, and serve.
