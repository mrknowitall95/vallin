## Green Dragon Blackbread Muffins

**Makes** 12 muffins

1 cup all-purpose flour

½ cup dark rye flour

½ cup medium-grind cornmeal (preferably stone-ground)

2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder (preferably Dutch-process)

1½ teaspoons baking soda

¾ teaspoon kosher salt

½ teaspoon baking powder

¼ cup neutral oil

4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled, plus butter at room temperature for serving

⅓ cup unsulfured molasses (not blackstrap)

¼ cup packed dark brown sugar

1 egg

¾ cup buttermilk

¾ cup currants or raisins (optional)

Choose a nonstick muffin tin with a gold-tone, or medium-grey finish (or other medium tone). These produce nicely browned baked goods, neither too dark (as is often the case with heavily sweetened batters in very dark bakeware), nor too light.

Baking soda, the primary leavener here, starts to react with the acidic ingredients in the batter on contact. Work quickly to fill the muffin tin, and get it into the oven at once so you don't lose too much leavening oomph.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 400°F. Coat a 12-cup muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray, or line with paper liners, and set aside.

In a large bowl, combine both flours, the cornmeal, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and baking powder and whisk to incorporate. In a medium bowl, combine the neutral oil, melted butter, molasses, and brown sugar and whisk, to break up any sugar lumps, until uniform. Add the egg and buttermilk and whisk until uniform. Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture and, using a flexible spatula, fold until they're incorporated into a batter with no dry patches (do not overmix). Fold in the currants (if using). Working quickly, using a large spoon or portion scoop, evenly divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups.

Bake the muffins until a toothpick inserted in the center of one or two comes out clean, about 15 minutes, rotating the muffin tin halfway through (do not overbake). Let the muffins cool in the tin for about 12 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool further, if desired. Serve with room-temperature butter.
