## Tika's Honey Mead

**Serves** 2

Small ice cubes for shaking

4 ounces off-dry (almost dry), traditional-style mead (such as Oliver Winery and Vineyards Camelot Mead)

2 ounces fresh orange juice

1½ ounces gin (such as London dry)

1 ounce honey syrup

½ ounce fresh lemon juice

2 orange twists

To chill a cocktail glass or coupe, put it in the freezer for an hour before using.

Chill two coupes or cocktail glasses (see Cook's Note).

Fill a large cocktail shaker about halfway with ice and add the mead, orange juice, gin, honey syrup, and lemon juice. Cover and shake until blended and chilled, about 30 seconds. Strain the mixture into the chilled glasses. Run an orange twist around the rim of each glass and then drop it in before serving.
