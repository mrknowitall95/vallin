## Kaeth

**Makes** about 2½ cups

⅓ cup ground dark-roast coffee

3 cups water

2 tablespoons light brown sugar

½ teaspoon molasses (not blackstrap)

1 cinnamon stick, broken in half

1 teaspoon crushed anise seeds

1½ tablespoons finely grated orange zest

1 small pinch kosher salt

If you prefer your kaeth iced, pour it from the French press into a jar with a tight-fitting lid. Allow it to cool to room temperature, seal the lid, and refrigerate until cold, about 3 hours. Serve over ice.

Place the coffee in a French press and set aside.

In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, combine the water, brown sugar, molasses, cinnamon stick, anise seeds, orange zest, and salt and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Adjust the heat to medium and let simmer until the mixture is fragrant and reduced to about 2⅔ cups, about 14 minutes. Pour the mixture into the French press and stir to fully moisten the coffee grounds. Position the lid on the pot and let steep for 4 minutes before slowly pressing the plunger. Serve immediately.
