## Boar Hock Soup

**Makes** about 2½ quarts

2 pounds pork butt, or boneless country-style ribs, patted dry with a paper towel

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil

3 large carrots, peeled and chopped

2 medium yellow onions, chopped

2 large bay leaves

1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme

2 teaspoons ground fennel

1 tablespoon pressed or grated garlic

6 cups low-sodium chicken broth

1½ pounds Yukon gold or all-purpose potatoes, peeled and cut into ¾-inch chunks

1½ pounds leeks (white and light green parts), halved lengthwise and cut into ¾-inch pieces

1½ cups cooked, peeled chestnuts, coarsely chopped

1½ teaspoons sherry vinegar

½ cup chopped fresh parsley

Sprinkle the pork all over with 1½ teaspoons salt and ¾ teaspoon pepper.

In a large Dutch oven over medium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the pork in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Turn the pork and continue cooking, undisturbed, to brown the second side, about 4 minutes longer. Transfer the pork to a large bowl, leaving the fat in the pot. When the pork is cool enough to handle, cut into ¾-inch pieces, discarding any large pieces of fat as you work. Set aside.

Return the Dutch oven to medium-high heat. Add the carrots, onions, bay leaves, thyme, fennel, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to loosen and dissolve the caramelized bits, until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes. Adjust the heat to medium-low, cover, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables release their juices, about 6 minutes longer. Scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen and dissolve the caramelized bits. Adjust the heat to medium-high, add the garlic, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the chicken broth and reserved pork with its accumulated juices and bring to a strong simmer. If foam forms on the surface, skim and discard it. Adjust the heat to low, cover, and let simmer until the pork is tender, about 40 minutes.

Adjust the heat to medium-high and bring the soup to a strong simmer. Add the potatoes, leeks, 1¼ cups of the chestnuts, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper and return to a simmer, stirring. Adjust the heat to medium-low, replace the cover, and continue simmering until the potato cubes and leeks begin to soften, about 20 minutes longer. Remove the soup from the heat and let rest for about 30 minutes for the flavors to meld (the potatoes and leeks will finish cooking during the rest). Remove the bay leaves.

Transfer about ¾ cup of the soup, including some potato cubes, to a blender. Add the reserved ¼ cup chestnuts and blend as smooth as possible, about 30 seconds. Scrape the pureed mixture into the pot, add the vinegar, and stir to incorporate. If necessary, reheat the soup over medium heat, and taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Add most of the parsley, stir to blend, and sprinkle each portion with some of the remaining parsley before serving.
