## Stuffed Trout

**Serves** 4

Four 10- to 12-ounce whole trout, gutted

2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning

Freshly ground black pepper

2 large slices multigrain sandwich bread, crusts trimmed, torn into small pieces

3 tablespoons unsalted butter

Kosher salt

¼ cup minced shallot

¾ cup finely chopped red bell pepper

2 teaspoons pressed or grated garlic

2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest, plus 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving

⅓ cup chopped fresh parsley

Eating a whole trout is less intimidating than you may think. Peel back the skin to expose the flesh on one side. Starting at the equator of the exposed side of the fish, use a dinner knife to slide the flesh downward off the fish's skeleton. Repeat to slide off the flesh above the equator. Flip the fish and repeat to release the flesh on the second side.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 450°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat and set aside.

Rinse each trout under cold running water and, using a paper towel, dry very well, inside and out. Sprinkle the cavity of each trout evenly with ½ teaspoon Old Bay and ¼ teaspoon black pepper.

In a food processor, pulse the bread into crumbs the size of grains of rice, about five 2-second pulses.

In a medium skillet over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter. Add the breadcrumbs and ½ teaspoon salt and season with pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until deeply browned and crisp, about 6 minutes. Scrape the toasted breadcrumbs into a medium bowl and set aside.

Wipe the skillet clean and return it to medium heat. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and let warm until melted. Add the shallot, bell pepper, and ½ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring constantly, until the vegetables start to soften, about 2 minutes. Adjust the heat to low, cover, and cook until the vegetables appear moist, about 1½ minutes longer. Add the garlic and lemon zest and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Scrape the mixture into the bowl with the toasted breadcrumbs, add the lemon juice and parsley, and stir to combine into a stuffing. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.

Place the trout on the prepared baking sheet. Spoon about ⅓ cup of the stuffing into the cavity of each trout, pressing it in with your fingers. Arrange the fish so there is about 1 inch between them.

Bake the trout until they feel firm when pressed gently with your finger, and the thickest part of the fish registers 140°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 12 minutes. Let the trout rest for 5 minutes. Using a fish spatula or another long spatula, carefully transfer the trout to a serving platter and serve with lemon wedges.
