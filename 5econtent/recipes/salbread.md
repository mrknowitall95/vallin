## Salbread

**Makes** one 8-inch square loaf

2 cups all-purpose flour

2 teaspoons baking powder

Kosher salt

1 cup granulated sugar

2 tablespoons finely grated lemon zest or orange zest

1 cup plain yogurt (preferably whole-milk)

2 eggs

½ teaspoon vanilla extract

½ cup neutral oil

Salbread can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 2 days.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 350°F. Coat an 8-inch square pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside.

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and ½ teaspoon salt and whisk to incorporate. In a large bowl, combine the sugar and lemon zest and stir until the sugar is moist and fragrant. Add the yogurt, eggs, vanilla, and neutral oil to the sugar and whisk vigorously to blend. Add the flour mixture and, using a flexible spatula, fold to blend the wet and dry ingredients just until no pockets of dry ingredients remain. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.

Bake the loaf until lightly browned, a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, and the edges begin to pull away from the pan, about 40 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack and let cool to room temperature, about 40 minutes. Turn the bread out of the pan and cut into squares to serve.
