## Kendermore Cobbler

**Serves** 4 to 6

#### Filling

3 pounds firm but ripe peaches, peeled, pitted, and cut into 1½-inch wedges, or 8 cups frozen peaches, thawed

3 tablespoons granulated sugar

1 pinch kosher salt

3 tablespoons light brown sugar

1 tablespoon cornstarch

¼ teaspoon ground cloves

3 tablespoons bourbon, amber or dark rum, brandy, or cognac (see Cook's Note)

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries (see Cook's Note)

#### Topping

5 tablespoons granulated sugar

¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon

1½ cups all-purpose flour

1½ teaspoons baking powder

½ teaspoon kosher salt

1 egg

⅓ cup buttermilk

3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

You can substitute 3 tablespoons of the exuded peach juices for the booze, if you wish.

If you use frozen blueberries, don't worry about defrosting them.

To make the filling: In a large strainer set over a large bowl, toss the peaches, granulated sugar, and salt and set aside to drain for 1 hour, tossing them once or twice during that time. Pour off the accumulated peach juices and reserve for another use, if desired.

In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, cornstarch, cloves, bourbon, and vanilla and whisk to incorporate.

Add the blueberries to the peaches, then add the cornstarch mixture and toss to coat. Scrape the filling into an 8-inch square pan with 2-inch sides, and spread into an even layer. Set aside.

With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat and set aside. Butter the inside of a ¼ cup dry measuring cup.

To make the topping: In a small bowl, combine 2 teaspoons of the granulated sugar and the cinnamon and stir to incorporate, then set aside.

In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and remaining 4 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon granulated sugar and whisk to incorporate. In a medium bowl, combine the egg, buttermilk, melted butter, and vanilla and whisk until uniform. Add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture and, using a large spoon, fold and stir until a dough forms and no dry patches remain (do not overmix).

Add enough of the dough to fill three-fourths of the prepared measuring cup and lightly pat into the cup to shape it. Turn out the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough for a total of nine rounds, spacing them 1 inch apart. Sprinkle with the reserved cinnamon sugar.

Bake the rounds until puffed, very lightly browned on the bottom, and partially cooked through, about 7 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through. Transfer the parbaked biscuits to a plate and set aside.

Set the pan with the filling on the baking sheet. Bake until the peaches begin to soften and release their juices, 30 to 40 minutes. Arrange the parbaked biscuits over the peaches and continue baking until the peaches are tender and the biscuits are golden brown, about 15 minutes longer. Let cool on a wire rack for 25 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
