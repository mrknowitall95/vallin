## Evermead

**Serves** 4

2 cinnamon sticks, broken in half

8 whole cloves

4 cups water

1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled, cut into 3 or 4 slices, and smashed

¼ cup honey

6 tablespoons seedless blackberry or boysenberry jam

Kosher salt

If you prefer the alcoholic version of Evermead, add about 1½ ounces of vodka or brandy per serving, garnish with a twist of orange.

In a saucepan over medium heat, warm the cinnamon sticks and cloves until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Carefully add the water (it may sputter) and ginger, adjust the heat to medium-high, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Add the honey, jam, and a tiny pinch of salt and return to a simmer, whisking to dissolve the honey and jam. Adjust the heat to low, partially cover the pot, and simmer to blend the flavors, about 20 minutes. Cover the pot completely, remove it from the heat, and let steep for 20 minutes more. Strain the mixture into a bowl or other container. Serve warm, at room temperature, or lightly chilled.
