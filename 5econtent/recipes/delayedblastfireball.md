## Delayed Blast Fireball

**Makes** about 1¾ cups

**Serves** 1 to 2

1½ cups bourbon

½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste

5 cinnamon sticks, broken in half

¼ cup packed light brown sugar

⅓ cup hot water

The ½ teaspoon of crushed red pepper will provide a noticeable, moderate heat. If you prefer a more intense heat, use up to 1 teaspoon. You can give the drink more flavor nuance by replacing the crushed red pepper flakes with toasted chile. Toast half of a small dried California, pasilla, or guajillo chile in a dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes. Cool the chile and tear into very small (½-inch) pieces. For extra heat, use some of the chile seeds as well.

This drink can be enjoyed neat, over ice, mixed with cola, or as the foundation of an excellent hot toddy with spiced chai.

In a clean glass jar with a lid, combine the bourbon, red pepper flakes, and cinnamon sticks. Screw on the lid, shake, and store in a cool, dark place to infuse for 5 days, shaking the jar at least once a day.

In a bowl, whisk the brown sugar and hot water to dissolve the sugar fully and set aside to cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes. Line a fine-mesh strainer with cheesecloth, set it over the bowl with the brown sugar mixture, and strain the bourbon into it.

Wash and dry the jar and return the firestar wine to it. Serve or store in a cool, dark place for up to 3 months.
