## Ruby Cordial

**Serves** 2

Small ice cubes

3 ounces ruby port

2 ounces brandy

½ ounce fresh lemon juice

⅓ ounce grenadine

2 lemon twists

2 cocktail cherries

Fill two small rocks or old-fashioned glasses about halfway with ice. Fill a large cocktail shaker about halfway with ice and add the port, brandy, lemon juice, and grenadine. Cover and shake to blend and chill, about 30 seconds. Strain the mixture into each glass. Run a lemon twist around the rim of each glass, drop it in, and garnish with a cherry before serving.
