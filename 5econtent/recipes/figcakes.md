## Fig Cakes

**Makes** 6 cakes

¾ cup slivered almonds, lightly toasted (see Cook's Note, this page) and cooled

8 ounces dried figs, quartered

1½ teaspoons finely grated lemon zest

¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon

¾ teaspoon ground anise

1 small pinch kosher salt

3 tablespoons brandy or cognac

⅓ cup sesame seeds, lightly toasted (see Cook's Note, this page) and cooled

In a food processor, pulse the almonds until fine but not pasty, about five 2-second pulses. Scrape the ground nuts into a medium bowl. Add the figs, lemon zest, cinnamon, anise, salt, and brandy to the food processor and process until very finely chopped and well blended, about 20 seconds, stopping to scrape down the sides as necessary. Add the ground almonds and pulse several times to incorporate them, about four 2-second pulses. Scrape the mixture into the medium bowl. Place the sesame seeds in a wide, shallow bowl.

Roll scant ¼-cup portions of the mixture into six balls, gently pressing as you roll to help them cohere. Press gently with your fingers to flatten and shape the balls into ovals about 3 inches long, 2 inches wide, and ½ inch thick. Working with one oval at a time, place it in the sesame seeds, pressing gently to help the seeds adhere to the bottom. Place the cakes, sesame-side up, on a plate. Let rest to firm up and dry out slightly, for 1 hour before serving.
