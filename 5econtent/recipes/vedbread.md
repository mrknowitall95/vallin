## Vedbread

**Makes** 14 buns

#### Filling

12 ounces cremini mushrooms, coarsely chopped (see Cook's Note)

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

2 shallots, finely chopped

Kosher salt

1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme

¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Freshly ground black pepper

#### Dough

2¼ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling

1 tablespoon baking powder

1 teaspoon sugar

½ teaspoon kosher salt

6 ounces Gruyère cheese, coarsely grated

¾ cup buttermilk, cold

6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled

1 egg

Truffle oil for brushing (optional)

You can use an equal quantity of stemmed, coarsely chopped shiitake mushrooms in place of the creminis.

***Make the Filling.*** In a food processor, pulse the mushrooms to finely chop, using about eight 1-second pulses.

In a skillet over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until they begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and ¼ teaspoon salt, adjust the heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms release their liquid and it evaporates fully, 9 to 12 minutes. Add the thyme and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat, add the Parmesan, and stir to mix. Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Spread the mixture on a plate and cool to room temperature.

Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the middle of the oven. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick (silicone) liner.

***Make the Dough.*** In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt. Add the grated Gruyère and whisk to combine.

In a small bowl, whisk the buttermilk and melted butter to combine (the butter will clump, which is fine). Add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture. With a sturdy spoon, stir to form a sticky, chunky dough. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface and knead until it holds together and is mostly smooth; do not overknead. Lift the dough and sprinkle more flour underneath it, if necessary, as well as over the surface. Roll or pat the dough into a roughly 12 by 18-inch rectangle; brush any excess flour off the surface.

Spread the cooled mushroom filling evenly over the entire surface of the dough; it will be a very thin, patchy layer. With the long side facing you, roll the dough into a very tight, even, compact cylinder. Pinch the seam along the entire length of the cylinder to fasten. Using a serrated knife in a sawing motion, trim off the very ends of the cylinder and discard. Cut the cylinder into 1¼-inch pieces (you should have about fourteen) and arrange them cut-sides up on the baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.

In a small bowl, beat the egg with 1 tablespoon water and brush the top and sides of each bun with the mixture. Bake until the buns are golden brown, about 18 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through.

Cool the buns on the pan for about 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool. Brush with a light coating of truffle oil (if using). Serve warm or at room temperature. Store leftover buns in an airtight container at room temperature and reheat them in a preheated 300°F oven for about 8 minutes before serving.
