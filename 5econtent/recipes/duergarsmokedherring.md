## Duergar Smoked Herring

**Serves** 4

1½ tablespoons neutral oil or extra-virgin olive oil

1 medium yellow onion, chopped

1 red bell pepper, cored, seeded, and chopped

1 Cubanelle pepper or a small green bell pepper, cored, seeded, and chopped

1 Scotch bonnet or habanero chile, pricked all over with a fork

Kosher salt

1 tablespoon tomato paste

2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme

1 teaspoon pressed or grated garlic

4 plum tomatoes, cored and chopped

Three 3.25-ounce tins smoked kipper snacks, drained

6 scallions (white and green parts), thinly sliced

1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, plus lime wedges for serving

Freshly ground black pepper

Sliced avocado and sliced hard-boiled egg are nice accompaniments. This easily becomes a full meal when served with rice and a salad.

In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the neutral oil until shimmering. Add the onion, red bell pepper, Cubanelle pepper, Scotch bonnet, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until fragrant and a shade darker, about 1½ minutes. Add the thyme and garlic and cook, stirring until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the kippers and cook, stirring occasionally and taking care not to completely shred the fish (though it will break down some as you stir, which is fine), until heated through, about 3 minutes longer. Add most of the scallions and the lime juice and season with black pepper, stirring to incorporate.

Remove the skillet from the heat and discard the whole chile. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary. Serve immediately, sprinkling each portion with some of the remaining scallions and a lime wedge on the side.
