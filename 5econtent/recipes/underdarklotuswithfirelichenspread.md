## Underdark Lotus with Fire Lichen Spread

**Serves** 6

1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed

1 pound carrots (about 4 large), peeled and chopped

¾ teaspoon cumin seeds or sweet paprika

1 teaspoon cayenne

3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

⅔ cup cold water, plus more as needed

¼ cup fresh lemon juice

¼ cup tahini

Radishes, sliced cucumbers, or romaine lettuce leaves for dipping

To create the lotus shape, arrange the vegetables around the bowl of spread as if they were the petals of a flower.

You can use your favorite kind of vegetable for dipping.

Preheat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.

On a large rimmed baking sheet, toss together the chickpeas, carrots, cumin, cayenne, and 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Sprinkle with ½ teaspoon salt and lots of pepper. Roast until the carrots are tender, about 25 minutes.

Transfer the roasted carrots and chickpeas to a food processor or blender. Add the water, lemon juice, tahini, and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Blend until completely smooth, adding more water, 1 tablespoon at a time, as needed to make the spread smooth and creamy.

Spoon the spread into a serving bowl, set the bowl on a large plate, and drizzle with olive oil. Arrange the radishes, sliced cucumbers, or romaine around the bowl, ready for dipping, and serve immediately.
