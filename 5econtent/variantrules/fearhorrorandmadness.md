## Fear, Horror, and Madness

In a typical campaign, characters can become **frightened** temporarily, but aren't typically driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day. But now, the stress of being an adventurer can sometimes be too much to bear, and if they encounter something too frightening for their mind to handle, it can cause them to experience **horror**, or even **madness**. And there can be a *lot* of potentially horrifying and threatening creatures and magical plane 

#### Going Mad

Various magical effects and creature encounters can now possibly inflict madness on you. Any spells or effects that mention causing **insanity**, are replaced by **madness** instead. Some diseases, poisons, and powerful effects can inflict madness as well.

#### Madness

The exact effects that you experience durring the madness can vary, and are determined by rolling on a table that is decided after you make a check or saving throw. 

Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects cause short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness, which requires healing or restorative magic to fully cure.
