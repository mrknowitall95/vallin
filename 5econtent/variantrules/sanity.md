## Sanity

A character with high Sanity is level-headed even in the face of insane circumstances, while a character with low Sanity is unsteady, breaking easily when confronted by horrors that are beyond normal reason.

***Sanity Checks.*** You might be asked to make make a Sanity check in place of various Intelligence or Wisdom checks when it is for something that will  madness. 

***Sanity Saving Throws.*** Your have to make a Sanity saving throw when your character runs the risk of succumbing to madness, such as in the following situations:

- Seeing a horrifying creature from and alien realm for the first time.
- Making direct contact with the mind of a powerful alien creature.
- Being subjected to spells that affect mental stability.
- Passing through a plane with alien physics.

A failed Sanity save might result in short-term, long-term, or indefinite madness. Any time you suffer from long-term or indefinite madness, your character's Sanity score is reduced by 1. A *greater restoration* spell can restore Sanity lost in this way, and you can't increase your Sanity score through level advancement.

When you create your character, the base starting Sanity score is 10, and the character options you choose will determine any modifiers to that score.
