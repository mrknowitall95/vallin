## Familiars

Any spellcaster that can cast the *find familiar* spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the *Player's Handbook*) or some other Tiny monster, such as a **crawling claw**, an **imp**, a **pseudodragon**, or a **quasit**.
