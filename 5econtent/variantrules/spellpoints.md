## Spell Points

Spell Points are the shit, if you didn't know, and completely optional to use and seamlessly convertible to Spell Slots so long as you aren't afraid of math! The limitation with Points is that levels 6-9 only allow one casting per long rest, which is the same as Spell Slots until you get to level 18.
