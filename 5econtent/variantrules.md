## Shared Campaign Variant Rules

A shared campaign might use some variant rules to handle certain aspects of the game. The Adventurers League, for instance, has variant systems for gaining levels and acquiring treasure. These "house rules," presented below, serve as a sort of common language, ensuring that the rewards all characters receive are equivalent no matter what kind of adventure a character experienced.

#### Character Advancement

In a shared campaign, characters gain levels not by accumulating experience points but by reaching experience checkpoints. This system rewards every character (and player) for taking part in a play session.

A character reaches 1 checkpoint for each hour an adventure is designed to last. Note that the award is based on the adventure's projected playing time, rather than the actual time spent at the table. The reward for completing an adventure designed for 2 hours of play is 2 checkpoints, even if a group spends more than 2 hours playing through it.

If a character completes an adventure designed for a tier higher than the character's current tier, the character is awarded 1 additional checkpoint. For example, if a 2nd-level character completes a 6th-level adventure designed to take 2 hours, the character reaches 3 checkpoints.

Playing time might seem like an odd way to measure experience awards, but the concept is in keeping with how a shared campaign is meant to work. A character played for 10 hours reaches the same number of checkpoints, whether the character went up against a dragon or spent all that time lurking in a pub. This approach ensures that a player's preferred style is neither penalized nor rewarded. Whether someone focuses on roleplaying and social interaction, defeating monsters in combat, or finding clever ways to avoid battles, this system gives credit where credit is due.

***Using Checkpoints.*** The number of checkpoints needed to gain the next level depends on a character's level:

- At levels 1–4, reaching 4 checkpoints is sufficient to advance to the next level.
- At level 5 or higher, reaching 8 checkpoints is needed to advance to the next level.

At the end of a play session, characters must level up if they have reached enough checkpoints to do so. The required number of checkpoints is expended, and any remaining checkpoints are applied toward the next opportunity for advancement.

#### Individual Treasure

In a shared campaign, each character receives a fixed number of gold pieces upon gaining a new level. (This gain represents the treasure a character might find in a standard adventure.)

As an additional benefit, characters are not required to put out gold to maintain a lifestyle. Instead, each character begins with a modest lifestyle, which improves as the character attains higher levels.

These benefits are summarized on the Individual Treasure table. Ways for characters to spend their treasure are covered in the "Buying and Selling" section below.

##### Individual Treasure
| Level Gained | Lifestyle    |   Reward |
|:------------:|--------------|---------:|
|      2-4     | Modest       |    75 gp |
|     5-10     | Comfortable  |   150 gp |
|     11-16    | Wealthy      |   550 gp |
|     17-20    | Aristocratic | 5,500 gp |

#### Magic Items

Characters earn treasure points from adventures, then redeem those points in exchange for magic items. The list of available magic items is agreed to and compiled by the DMs running the campaign.

***Gaining Treasure Points.*** Each character earns treasure points based on an adventure's tier and its intended playing time:

- 1 treasure point is awarded for every 2 hours played in a tier 1 or tier 2 adventure.
- 1 treasure point is awarded for every 1 hour played in a tier 3 or tier 4 adventure.

As with the variant rules for gaining levels, this award is based on the adventure's projected playing time, rather than the actual time a group spent at the table.

If a character completes an adventure of a tier higher than that character's tier, the character receives 1 additional treasure point for that adventure.

***Creating an Item List.*** The DMs of the shared campaign should work together to compile a list of magic items that players can purchase. The magic item tables in chapter 2 of this book and in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide are the obvious starting point. Choosing which items to allow or ban is a matter of personal preference, just as it is for the DM in a standard campaign. Involving all the DMs helps to ensure that the list meets everyone's expectations. When in doubt, disallow an item; it's easier to add it to the available items at a later time than it would be to remove it from the game once it has been handed out.

Naturally, the list of available items is longer for adventures in the higher tiers, and the point cost of those higher-tier items likewise increases. The Magic Items by Tier table provides the details.

For instance, treasure points from a tier 1 adventure can be spent on items from tables A, B, C, and F. Any item on the first three tables costs 4 points, and an item from table F costs 8 points.

##### Magic Items by Tier
| Magic Item Table | Available at Tiers | Point Cost |
|:----------------:|:------------------:|:----------:|
|         A        |         1–4        |      4     |
|         B        |         1–4        |      4     |
|         C        |         1–4        |      4     |
|         D        |         2–4        |      8     |
|         E        |         3–4        |      8     |
|         F        |         1–4        |      8     |
|         G        |         2–4        |     10     |
|         H        |         3–4        |     10     |
|         I        |         3–4        |     12     |

***Spending Treasure Points.*** Players must spend treasure points at the end of a play session, immediately after determining whether their characters have gained a level. The order of these steps is important, since a character might enter a new tier because of the level gain.

Players are entitled to choose any approved item from one of the magic item tables available in the current tier. Treasure points can be spread across multiple items.

Many items cost more treasure points than a character can earn in a 2- or 4-hour adventure. To buy such an item, a character can make a deposit, spending treasure points on the item until it's paid off, at which time the character gains the item.

#### Buying and Selling

Characters can use their monetary treasure to purchase anything from the equipment lists in chapter 5 of the *Player's Handbook*. In addition, the Adventurers League allows characters to purchase potions and spell scrolls, as detailed below. A *spell scroll* can be purchased only by a character who is capable of casting the spell in question.

##### Potions for Sale
|     Potion of...    |   Cost   |     |
|:-------------------:|:--------:|:---:|
|      *Healing*      |   50 gp  |
|      *Climbing*     |   75 gp  |
| *Animal friendship* |  100 gp  |
|  *Greater healing*  |  100 gp  |
|  *Water breathing*  |  100 gp  |
|  *Superior healing* |  500 gp  |
|  *Supreme healing*  | 5,000 gp |
|    *Invisibility*   | 5,000 gp |

##### Spell Scrolls for Sale
| Spell Level |   Cost   |     |
|:-----------:|:--------:|:---:|
|   Cantrip   |   25 gp  |
|     1st     |   75 gp  |
|     2nd     |  150 gp  |
|     3rd     |  300 gp  |
|     4th     |  500 gp  |
|     5th     | 1,000 gp |

***Selling Items.*** In a shared campaign, characters are not entitled to sell items they find on adventures or equipment they purchase with their personal funds. Weapons, armor, and other gear used by enemies are considered too damaged to have any monetary value.

## Downtime Activity: Research

Forewarned is forearmed. The research downtime activity allows a character to delve into lore concerning a monster, a location, a magic item, or some other particular topic.

#### Resources

Typically, a character needs access to a library or a sage to conduct research. Assuming such access is available, conducting research requires one workweek of effort and at least 50 gp spent on materials, bribes, gifts, and other expenses.

#### Resolution

The character declares the focus of the research—a specific person, place, or thing. After one workweek, the character makes an Intelligence check with a +1 bonus per 50 gp spent beyond the initial 50 gp, to a maximum of +6. In addition, a character who has access to a particularly well-stocked library or knowledgeable sages gains advantage on this check. Determine how much lore a character learns using the Research Outcomes table.

##### Research Outcomes
| Check Total | Outcome                         |
|:-----------:|---------------------------------|
|     1–5     | No effect.                      |
|     6–10    | You learn one piece of lore.    |
|    11–20    | You learn two pieces of lore.   |
|     21+     | You learn three pieces of lore. |

Each piece of lore is the equivalent of one true statement about a person, place, or thing. Examples include knowledge of a creature's resistances, the password needed to enter a sealed dungeon level, the spells commonly prepared by an order of wizards, and so on.

As DM, you are the final arbiter concerning exactly what a character learns. For a monster or an NPC, you can reveal elements of statistics or personality. For a location, you can reveal secrets about it, such as a hidden entrance, the answer to a riddle, or the nature of a creature that guards the place.

#### Complications

The greatest risk in research is uncovering false information. Not all lore is accurate or truthful, and a rival with a scholarly bent might try to lead the character astray, especially if the object of the research is known to the rival. The rival might plant false information, bribe sages to give bad advice, or steal key tomes needed to find the truth.

In addition, a character might run into other complications during research. Every workweek spent in research brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Research Complications table.

##### Research Complications
|  d6 | Complication                                                                                |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | You accidentally damage a rare book.                                                        |
|  2  | You offend a sage, who demands an extravagant gift.*                                        |
|  3  | If you had known that book was cursed, you never would have opened it.                      |
|  4  | A sage becomes obsessed with convincing you of a number of strange theories about reality.* |
|  5  | Your actions cause you to be banned from a library until you make reparations.*             |
|  6  | You uncovered useful lore, but only by promising to complete a dangerous task in return.    |
*Might involve a rival

## Downtime Activity: Religious Service

Characters with a religious bent might want to spend downtime in service to a temple, either by attending rites or by proselytizing in the community. Someone who undertakes this activity has a chance of winning the favor of the temple's leaders.

#### Resources

Performing religious service requires access to, and often attendance at, a temple whose beliefs and ethos align with the character's. If such a place is available, the activity takes one workweek of time but involves no gold piece expenditure.

#### Resolution

At the end of the required time, the character chooses to make either an Intelligence (Religion) check or a Charisma (Persuasion) check. The total of the check determines the benefits of service, as shown on the Religious Service table.

##### Religious Service
| Check Total | Result                                                     |
|:-----------:|------------------------------------------------------------|
|     1–10    | No effect. Your efforts fail to make a lasting impression. |
|    11–20    | You earn one favor.                                        |
|     21+     | You earn two favors.                                       |

A favor, in broad terms, is a promise of future assistance from a representative of the temple. It can be expended to ask the temple for help in dealing with a specific problem, for general political or social support, or to reduce the cost of cleric spellcasting by 50 percent. A favor could also take the form of a deity's intervention, such as an omen, a vision, or a minor miracle provided at a key moment. This latter sort of favor is expended by the DM, who also determines its nature.

Favors earned need not be expended immediately, but only a certain number can be stored up. A character can have a maximum number of unused favors equal to 1 + the character's Charisma modifier (minimum of one unused favor).

#### Complications

Temples can be labyrinths of political and social scheming. Even the best-intentioned sect can fall prone to rivalries. A character who serves a temple risks becoming embroiled in such struggles. Every workweek spent in religious service brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Religious Service Complications table.

##### Religious Service Complications
|  d6 | Complication                                                                           |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | You have offended a priest through your words or actions.*                             |
|  2  | Blasphemy is still blasphemy, even if you did it by accident.                          |
|  3  | A secret sect in the temple offers you membership.                                     |
|  4  | Another temple tries to recruit you as a spy.*                                         |
|  5  | The temple elders implore you to take up a holy quest.                                 |
|  6  | You accidentally discover that an important person in the temple is a fiend worshiper. |

## Downtime Activity: Relaxation

Sometimes the best thing to do between adventures is relax. Whether a character wants a hard-earned vacation or needs to recover from injuries, relaxation is the ideal option for adventurers who need a break. This option is also ideal for players who don't want to make use of the downtime system.

#### Resources

Relaxation requires one week. A character needs to maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing to gain the benefit of the activity.

#### Resolution

Characters who maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing gain several benefits. While relaxing, a character gains advantage on saving throws to recover from long-acting diseases and poisons. In addition, at the end of the week, a character can end one effect that keeps the character from regaining hit points, or can restore one ability score that has been reduced to less than its normal value. This benefit cannot be used if the harmful effect was caused by a spell or some other magical effect with an ongoing duration.

#### Complications

Relaxation rarely comes with complications. If you want to make life complicated for the characters, introduce an action or an event connected to a rival.

---

## Downtime Activity: Gambling

Games of chance are a way to make a fortune—and perhaps a better way to lose one.

#### Resources

This activity requires one workweek of effort plus a stake of at least 10 gp, to a maximum of 1,000 gp or more, as you see fit.

#### Resolution

The character must make a series of checks, with a DC determined at random based on the quality of the competition that the character runs into. Part of the risk of gambling is that one never knows who might end up sitting across the table.

The character makes three checks: Wisdom (Insight), Charisma (Deception), and Charisma (Intimidation). If the character has proficiency with an appropriate *gaming set*, that tool proficiency can replace the relevant skill in any of the checks. The DC for each of the checks is 5 + 2d10; generate a separate DC for each one. Consult the Gambling Results table to see how the character did.

##### Gambling Results
| Result      | Value                                                               |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0 successes | Lose all the money you bet, and accrue a debt equal to that amount. |
| 1 success   | Lose half the money you bet.                                        |
| 2 successes | Gain the amount you bet plus half again more.                       |
| 3 successes | Gain double the amount you bet.                                     |

#### Complications

Gambling tends to attract unsavory individuals. The potential complications involved come from run-ins with the law and associations with various criminals tied to the activity. Every workweek spent gambling brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Gambling Complications table.

##### Gambling Complications

## Downtime Activity: Crime

Sometimes it pays to be bad. This activity gives a character the chance to make some extra cash, at the risk of arrest.

#### Resources

A character must spend one week and at least 25 gp gathering information on potential targets before committing the intended crime.

#### Resolution

The character must make a series of checks, with the DC for all the checks chosen by the character according to the amount of profit sought from the crime.

The chosen DC can be 10, 15, 20, or 25. Successful completion of the crime yields a number of gold pieces, as shown on the Loot Value table.

To attempt a crime, the character makes three checks: Dexterity (Stealth), Dexterity using *thieves' tools*, and the player's choice of Intelligence (Investigation), Wisdom (Perception), or Charisma (Deception).

If none of the checks are successful, the character is caught and jailed. The character must pay a fine equal to the profit the crime would have earned and must spend one week in jail for each 25 gp of the fine.

If only one check is successful, the heist fails but the character escapes.

If two checks are successful, the heist is a partial success, netting the character half the payout.

If all three checks are successful, the character earns the full value of the loot.

##### Loot Value
|  DC | Value                                                   |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------|
|  10 | 50 gp, robbery of a struggling merchant                 |
|  15 | 100 gp, robbery of a prosperous merchant                |
|  20 | 200 gp, robbery of a noble                              |
|  25 | 1,000 gp, robbery of one of the richest figures in town |

#### Complications

A life of crime is filled with complications. Roll on the Crime Complications table (or create a complication of your own) if the character succeeds on only one check. If the character's rival is involved in crime or law enforcement, a complication ensues if the character succeeds on only two checks.

##### Crime Complications

## Downtime Activity: Crafting an Item

A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of nonmagical gear.

#### Resources and Resolution

In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the item's selling cost. To determine how many workweeks it takes to create an item, divide its gold piece cost by 50. A character can complete multiple items in a workweek if the items' combined cost is 50 gp or lower. Items that cost more than 50 gp can be completed over longer periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Use your judgment when determining how many characters can collaborate on an item. A particularly tiny item, like a ring, might allow only one or two workers, whereas a large, complex item might allow four or more workers.

A character needs to be proficient with the tools needed to craft an item and have access to the appropriate equipment. Everyone who collaborates needs to have the appropriate tool proficiency. You need to make any judgment calls regarding whether a character has the correct equipment. The following table provides some examples.

| Proficiency             | Items                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| *Herbalism kit*         | Antitoxin, *potion of healing* |
| *Leatherworker's tools* | Leather armor, boots           |
| *Smith's tools*         | Armor, weapons                 |
| *Weaver's tools*        | Cloaks, robes                  |

If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is an item of the desired sort. A character can sell an item crafted in this way at its listed price.

#### Crafting Magic Items

Creating a magic item requires more than just time, effort, and materials. It is a long-term process that involves one or more adventures to track down rare materials and the lore needed to create the item.

Potions of healing and spell scrolls are exceptions to the following rules. For more information, see "Brewing Potions of Healing" later in this section and the "Scribing a *Spell Scroll*" section, below.

To start with, a character needs a formula for a magic item in order to create it. The formula is like a recipe. It lists the materials needed and steps required to make the item.

An item invariably requires an exotic material to complete it. This material can range from the skin of a yeti to a vial of water taken from a whirlpool on the Elemental Plane of Water. Finding that material should take place as part of an adventure.

The Magic Item Ingredients table suggests the challenge rating of a creature that the characters need to face to acquire the materials for an item. Note that facing a creature does not necessarily mean that the characters must collect items from its corpse. Rather, the creature might guard a location or a resource that the characters need access to.

##### Magic Item Ingredients
| Item Rarity | CR Range |
|-------------|:--------:|
| Common      |    1–3   |
| Uncommon    |    4–8   |
| Rare        |   9–12   |
| Very rare   |   13–18  |
| Legendary   |    19+   |

If appropriate, pick a monster or a location that is a thematic fit for the item to be crafted. For example, creating *mariner's armor* might require the essence of a water weird. Crafting a *staff of charming* might require the cooperation of a specific arcanaloth, who will help only if the characters complete a task for it. Making a *staff of power* might hinge on acquiring a piece of an ancient stone that was once touched by the god of magic—a stone now guarded by a suspicious androsphinx.

In addition to facing a specific creature, creating an item comes with a gold piece cost covering other materials, tools, and so on, based on the item's rarity. Those values, as well as the time a character needs to work in order to complete the item, are shown on the Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table. Halve the listed price and creation time for any consumable items.

##### Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost
| Item Rarity | Workweeks* |      Cost* |
|-------------|:----------:|-----------:|
| Common      |      1     |      50 gp |
| Uncommon    |      2     |     200 gp |
| Rare        |     10     |   2,000 gp |
| Very rare   |     25     |  20,000 gp |
| Legendary   |     50     | 100,000 gp |
*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll
To complete a magic item, a character also needs whatever tool proficiency is appropriate, as for crafting a nonmagical object, or proficiency in the Arcana skill.

If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is a magic item of the desired sort.

#### Complications

Most of the complications involved in creating something, especially a magic item, are linked to the difficulty in finding rare ingredients or components needed to complete the work. The complications a character might face as byproducts of the creation process are most interesting when the characters are working on a magic item: there's a 10 percent chance for every five workweeks spent on crafting an item that a complication occurs. The Crafting Complications table provides examples of what might happen.

#### Brewing Potions of Healing

Potions of healing fall into a special category for item crafting, separate from other magic items. A character who has proficiency with the *herbalism kit* can create these potions. The times and costs for doing so are summarized on the *Potion of Healing* Creation table.

##### Potion of Healing Creation
| Type             | Time        |      Cost |
|------------------|-------------|----------:|
| Healing          | 1 day       |     25 gp |
| Greater healing  | 1 workweek  |    100 gp |
| Superior healing | 3 workweeks |  1,000 gp |
| Supreme healing  | 4 workweeks | 10,000 gp |

## Downtime Activity: Carousing

Carousing is a default downtime activity for many characters. Between adventures, who doesn't want to relax with a few drinks and a group of friends at a tavern?

#### Resources

Carousing covers a workweek of fine food, strong drink, and socializing. A character can attempt to carouse among lower-, middle-, or upper-class folk. A character can carouse with the lower class for 10 gp to cover expenses, or 50 gp for the middle class. Carousing with the upper class requires 250 gp for the workweek and access to the local nobility.

A character with the noble background can mingle with the upper class, but other characters can do so only if you judge that the character has made sufficient contacts. Alternatively, a character might use a *disguise kit* and the Deception skill to pass as a noble visiting from a distant city.

#### Resolution

After a workweek of carousing, a character stands to make contacts within the selected social class. The character makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check using the Carousing table.

##### Carousing
| Check Total | Result                                    |
|:-----------:|-------------------------------------------|
|     1–5     | Character has made a hostile contact.     |
|     6–10    | Character has made no new contacts.       |
|    11–15    | Character has made an allied contact.     |
|    16–20    | Character has made two allied contacts.   |
|     21+     | Character has made three allied contacts. |

Contacts are NPCs who now share a bond with the character. Each one either owes the character a favor or has some reason to bear a grudge. A hostile contact works against the character, placing obstacles but stopping short of committing a crime or a violent act. Allied contacts are friends who will render aid to the character, but not at the risk of their lives.

Lower-class contacts include criminals, laborers, mercenaries, the town guard, and any other folk who normally frequent the cheapest taverns in town.

Middle-class contacts include guild members, spellcasters, town officials, and other folk who frequent well-kept establishments.

Upper-class contacts are nobles and their personal servants. Carousing with such folk covers formal banquets, state dinners, and the like.

Once a contact has helped or hindered a character, the character needs to carouse again to get back into the NPC's good graces. A contact provides help once, not help for life. The contact remains friendly, which can influence roleplaying and how the characters interact with them, but doesn't come with a guarantee of help.

You can assign specific NPCs as contacts. You might decide that the barkeep at the Wretched Gorgon and a guard stationed at the western gate are the character's allied contacts. Assigning specific NPCs gives the players concrete options. It brings the campaign to life and seeds the area with NPCs that the characters care about. On the other hand, it can prove difficult to track and might render a contact useless if that character doesn't come into play.

Alternatively, you can allow the player to make an NPC into a contact on the spot, after carousing. When the characters are in the area in which they caroused, a player can expend an allied contact and designate an NPC they meet as a contact, assuming the NPC is of the correct social class based on how the character caroused. The player should provide a reasonable explanation for this relationship and work it into the game.

Using a mix of the two approaches is a good idea, since it gives you the added depth of specific contacts while giving players the freedom to ensure that the contacts they accumulate are useful.

The same process can apply to hostile contacts. You can give the characters a specific NPC they should avoid, or you might introduce one at an inopportune or dramatic moment.

At any time, a character can have a maximum number of unspecified allied contacts equal to 1 + the character's Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). Specific, named contacts don't count toward this limit—only ones that can be used at any time to declare an NPC as a contact.

#### Complications

Characters who carouse risk bar brawls, accumulating a cloud of nasty rumors, and building a bad reputation around town. As a rule of thumb, a character has a 10 percent chance of triggering a complication for each workweek of carousing.

## Downtime Activity: Work

When all else fails, an adventurer can turn to an honest trade to earn a living. This activity represents a character's attempt to find temporary work, the quality and wages of which are difficult to predict.

#### Resources

Performing a job requires one workweek of effort.

#### Resolution

To determine how much money a character earns, the character makes an ability check: Strength (Athletics), Dexterity (Acrobatics), Intelligence using a set of tools, Charisma (Performance), or Charisma using a *musical instrument*. Consult the Wages table to see how much money is generated according to the total of the check.

##### Wages
| Check Total | Earnings                                   |
|:-----------:|--------------------------------------------|
|  9 or lower | Poor lifestyle for the week                |
|    10–14    | Modest lifestyle for the week              |
|    15–20    | Comfortable lifestyle for the week         |
|     21+     | Comfortable lifestyle for the week + 25 gp |

#### Complications

Ordinary work is rarely filled with significant complications. Still, the Work Complications table can add some difficulties to a worker's life. Each workweek of activity brings a 10 percent chance that a character encounters a complication.

##### Work Complications
|  d6 | Complication                                                                                                                                                                            |
|:---:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | A difficult customer or a fight with a coworker reduces the wages you earn by one category.*                                                                                            |
|  2  | Your employer's financial difficulties result in your not being paid.*                                                                                                                  |
|  3  | A coworker with ties to an important family in town takes a dislike to you.*                                                                                                            |
|  4  | Your employer is involved with a dark cult or a criminal enterprise.                                                                                                                    |
|  5  | A crime ring targets your business for extortion.*                                                                                                                                      |
|  6  | You gain a reputation for laziness (unjustified or not, as you choose), giving you disadvantage on checks made for this downtime activity for the next six workweeks you devote to it.* |
*Might involve a rival

## Downtime Activity: Training

Given enough free time and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language or pick up proficiency with a tool.

#### Resources

Receiving training in a language or tool typically takes at least ten workweeks, but this time is reduced by a number of workweeks equal to the character's Intelligence modifier (an Intelligence penalty doesn't increase the time needed). Training costs 25 gp per workweek.

#### Complications

Complications that arise while training typically involve the teacher. Every ten workweeks spent in training brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Training Complications table.

##### Training Complications
|  d6 | Complication                                                                          |
|:---:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Your instructor disappears, forcing you to spend one workweek finding a new one.*     |
|  2  | Your teacher instructs you in rare, archaic methods, which draw comments from others. |
|  3  | Your teacher is a spy sent to learn your plans.*                                      |
|  4  | Your teacher is a wanted criminal.                                                    |
|  5  | Your teacher is a cruel taskmaster.                                                   |

## Downtime Activity: Selling a Magic Item

Selling a magic item is by no means an easy task. Con artists and thieves are always looking out for an easy score, and there's no guarantee that a character will receive a good offer even if a legitimate buyer is found.

#### Resources

A character can find a buyer for one magic item by spending one workweek and 25 gp, which is used to spread word of the desired sale. A character must pick one item at a time to sell.

#### Resolution

A character who wants to sell an item must make a Charisma (Persuasion) check to determine what kind of offer comes in. The character can always opt not to sell, instead forfeiting the workweek of effort and trying again later. Use the Magic Item Base Prices and Magic Item Offer tables to determine the sale price.

##### Magic Item Base Prices
|   Rarity  | Base Price* |
|:---------:|-------------|
|   Common  | 100 gp      |
|  Uncommon | 400 gp      |
|    Rare   | 4,000 gp    |
| Very rare | 40,000 gp   |
| Legendary | 200,000 gp  |
*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll

##### Magic Item Offer
| Check Total | Offer              |
|:-----------:|--------------------|
|     1–10    | 50% of base price  |
|    11–20    | 100% of base price |
|     21+     | 150% of base price |

#### Complications

The main risk in selling a magic item lies in attracting thieves and anyone else who wants the item but doesn't want to pay for it. Other folk might try to undermine a deal in order to bolster their own business or seek to discredit the character as a legitimate seller. Every workweek spent trying to sell an item brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Magic Item Sale Complications table.

##### Magic Item Sale Complications
|  d6 | Complication                                                                                   |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | Your enemy secretly arranges to buy the item to use it against you.*                           |
|  2  | A thieves' guild, alerted to the sale, attempts to steal your item.*                           |
|  3  | A foe circulates rumors that your item is a fake.*                                             |
|  4  | A sorcerer claims your item as a birthright and demands you hand it over.                      |
|  5  | Your item's previous owner, or surviving allies of the owner, vow to retake the item by force. |
|  6  | The buyer is murdered before the sale is finalized.*                                           |

## Sleep

Just as in the real world, D&D characters spend many hours sleeping, most often as part of a long rest. Most monsters also need to sleep. While a creature sleeps, it is subjected to the unconscious condition. Here are a few rules that expand on that basic fact.

#### Waking Someone

A creature that is naturally sleeping, as opposed to being in a magically or chemically induced sleep, wakes up if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake. A sudden loud noise—such as yelling, thunder, or a ringing bell—also awakens someone that is sleeping naturally.

Whispers don't disturb sleep, unless a sleeper's passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 20 or higher and the whispers are within 10 feet of the sleeper. Speech at a normal volume awakens a sleeper if the environment is otherwise silent (no wind, birdsong, crickets, street sounds, or the like) and the sleeper has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher.

#### Sleeping in Armor

Sleeping in light armor has no adverse effect on the wearer, but sleeping in medium or heavy armor makes it difficult to recover fully during a long rest.

When you finish a long rest during which you slept in medium or heavy armor, you regain only one quarter of your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one die). If you have any levels of exhaustion, the rest doesn't reduce your exhaustion level.

#### Going without a Long Rest

A long rest is never mandatory, but going without sleep does have its consequences. If you want to account for the effects of sleep deprivation on characters and creatures, use these rules.

Whenever you end a 24-hour period without finishing a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.

It becomes harder to fight off exhaustion if you stay awake for multiple days. After the first 24 hours, the DC increases by 5 for each consecutive 24-hour period without a long rest. The DC resets to 10 when you finish a long rest.

## Parleying with Monsters

*Why fight if a lively chat is possible? If things get out of hand, just show yourself out with a dimension door.*— Tasha

Meeting a monster doesn't have to spark a fight. An offering, like food, can calm some hostile monsters, and sapient creatures often prefer to talk than to draw weapons. If the adventurers try to parley with a monster, you may improvise the encounter or use the *social interaction rules* in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. Consider granting the characters advantage on any ability check they make to communicate with a creature if they offer something it wants. The "Monsters' Desires" section below suggest things that a creature might like, depending on its type.

![Adventurers offer meat to an owlbear.](img/book/TCE/095-04-006.webp)

#### Monster Research

Adventurers can research what a creature is likely to desire. The Monster Research table suggests which skills can be used to learn about a creature of a particular type. The DC for a relevant ability check equals 10 + the creature's challenge rating.

## Renown

Renown is an optional rule you can use to track an adventurer's standing within a particular faction or organization. Renown is a numerical value that starts at 0, then increases as a character earns favor and reputation within a particular organization. You can tie benefits to a character's renown, including ranks and titles within the organization and access to resources.

A player tracks renown separately for each organization his or her character is a member of. For example, an adventurer might have 5 renown within one faction and 20 renown within another, based on the character's interaction with each organization over the course of the campaign.

#### Gaining Renown

A character earns renown by completing missions or quests that serve an organization's interests or involve the organization directly. You award renown at your discretion as characters complete these missions or quests, typically at the same time you award experience points.

Advancing an organization's interests increases a character's renown within that organization by 1. Completing a mission specifically assigned by that organization, or which directly benefits the organization, increases the character's renown by 2 instead.

For example, characters with connections to the noble Order of the Gauntlet complete a mission in which they free a town from the tyranny of a blue dragon. Because the order likes to punish evildoers, you might increase each character's renown within the order by 1. Conversely, if killing the dragon was a mission given to the adventurers by a senior member of the order, completing the task might instead increase each character's renown by 2, showing the adventurers as effective allies.

Meanwhile, the party's rogue might have looted a box of rare poisons from the dragon's hoard and sold it to a fence who is secretly a Zhentarim agent. You might increase the rogue's renown within the Zhentarim by 2 since this action directly increased that group's power and wealth, even though the task was not assigned by an agent of the Zhentarim.

#### Benefits of Renown

The benefits of increasing renown within an organization can include rank and authority, friendly attitudes from members of the organization, and other perks.

***Rank.*** Characters can earn promotions as their renown increases. You can establish certain thresholds of renown that serve as prerequisites (though not necessarily the only prerequisites) for advancing in rank, as shown in the Examples of Faction Ranks table. For example, a character might join the Lords' Alliance after earning 1 renown within that organization, gaining the title of cloak. As the character's renown within the organization increases, he or she might be eligible for further increases in rank.

You can add rank prerequisites. For example, a character affiliated with the Lords' Alliance might have to be at least 5th level before becoming a stingblade, at least 10th level to be a warduke, and at least 15th level to be a lioncrown.

You can set these thresholds of renown to any numbers that work for your game, creating appropriate ranks and titles for the organizations in your campaign.

##### Examples of Faction Ranks
| Renown | Harpers      | Order of the Gauntlet | Emerald Enclave    | Lords' Alliance | Zhentarim  |
|--------|--------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------|------------|
| 1      | Watcher      | Chevall               | Springwarden       | Cloak           | Fang       |
| 3      | Harpshadow   | Marcheon              | Summerstrider      | Redknife        | Wolf       |
| 10     | Brightcandle | Whitehawk             | Autumnreaver       | Stingblade      | Viper      |
| 25     | Wise Owl     | Vindicator            | Winterstalker      | Warduke         | Ardragon   |
| 50     | High Harper  | Righteous Hand        | Master of the Wild | Lioncrown       | Dread Lord |

***Attitudes of Organization Members.*** As a character's renown within an organization grows, members of that organization are increasingly likely to have heard of the character. You can set thresholds at which the default attitude of an organization's members toward the character becomes indifferent or friendly. For example, members of the Emerald Enclave—a faction dedicated to preserving the natural order—might be less friendly toward characters who have not cultivated at least 3 renown within that organization, becoming friendly by default only when a character has gained 10 renown within the Emerald Enclave. These thresholds apply only to the default attitude of most members of an organization, and such attitudes aren't automatic. NPC faction members might dislike an adventurer despite that character's renown—or perhaps because of it.

***Perks.*** Earning a rank within an organization comes with certain benefits, as defined by you. A character of low rank might gain access to a reliable contact and adventure leads, a safe house, or a trader willing to offer a discount on adventuring gear. A middle-ranked character might gain a follower (see chapter 4, "Creating Nonplayer Characters"), access to potions and scrolls, the ability to call in a favor, or backup on dangerous missions. A high-ranking character might be able to call on a small army, take custody of a rare magic item, gain access to a helpful spellcaster, or assign special missions to members of lower rank.

***Downtime Activities.*** You might allow characters to spend downtime between adventures building relationships and gaining renown within an organization. For more information on downtime activities, see chapter 6, "Between Adventures."

#### Losing Renown

Disagreements with members of an organization aren't enough to cause a loss of renown within that organization. However, serious offenses committed against the organization or its members can result in a loss of renown and rank within the organization. The extent of the loss depends on the infraction and is left to your discretion. A character's renown within an organization can never drop below 0.

#### Piety

With a few alterations, the renown system can also serve as a measure of a character's link to the gods. It's a great option for campaigns where the gods take active roles in the world.

Using this approach, you track renown based on specific divine figures in your campaign. Each character has the option to select a patron deity or pantheon with goals, doctrine, and taboos that you have created. Any renown he or she earns is called piety. A character gains piety for honoring his or her gods, fulfilling their commands, and respecting their taboos. A character loses piety for working against those gods, dishonoring them, defiling their temples, and foiling their aims.

The gods bestow favors on those who prove their devotion. With each rank of piety gained, a character can pray for divine favor once per day. This favor usually comes in the form of a cleric spell like bless. The favor often comes with a sign of the divine benefactor; for example, a character dedicated to Thor might receive a spell accompanied by the boom of thunder.

A high level of piety can also lead to a character gaining a more persistent benefit, in the form of a blessing or charm (see chapter 7, "Treasure," for such supernatural gifts).

## Planar Effects

When adventurers travel to other planes of existence, they undertake a legendary journey that might force them to face supernatural guardians and undergo various ordeals. You can choose to add effects to any or all of the planes, to better represent their uniqueness. The effects listed below apply to the default cosmological arrangement presented in the *Player's Handbook*, and are individually optional.

#### Feywild: Feywild Magic

Tales speak of children kidnapped by fey creatures and spirited away to the Feywild, only to return to their parents years later without having aged a day, and with no memories of their captors or the realm they came from. Likewise, adventurers who return from an excursion to the Feywild are often alarmed to discover upon their return that time flows differently on the Plane of Faerie, and that the memories of their visit are hazy. You can use these optional rules to reflect the strange magic that suffuses the plane.

***Memory Loss.*** A creature that leaves the Feywild must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. Fey creatures automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do any creatures, like elves, that have the Fey Ancestry trait. A creature that fails the saving throw remembers nothing from its time spent in the Feywild. On a successful save, the creature's memories remain intact but are a little hazy. Any spell that can end a curse can restore the creature's lost memories.

***Time Warp.*** While time seems to pass normally in the Feywild, characters might spend a day there and realize, upon leaving the plane, that less or more time has elapsed everywhere else in the multiverse.

Whenever a creature or group of creatures leaves the Feywild after spending at least 1 day on that plane, you can choose a time change that works best for your campaign, if any, or roll on the Feywild Time Warp table. A *wish* spell can be used to remove the effect on up to ten creatures. Some powerful fey have the ability to grant such wishes and might do so if the beneficiaries agree to subject themselves to a *geas* spell and complete a quest after the *wish* spell is cast.

##### Feywild Time Warp
|  d20  | Result              |
|:-----:|---------------------|
|  1-2  | Days become minutes |
|  3-6  | Days become hours   |
|  7-13 | No change           |
| 14-17 | Days become weeks   |
| 18-19 | Days become months  |
|   20  | Days become years   |

#### Shadowfell: Shadowfell Despair

A melancholic atmosphere pervades the Shadowfell. Extended forays to this plane can afflict characters with despair, as reflected in this optional rule.

When you deem it appropriate, though usually not more than once per day, you can require a character not native to the Shadowfell to make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the character is affected by despair. Roll a d6 to determine the effects, using the Shadowfell Despair table. You can substitute different despair effects of your own creation.

##### Shadowfell Despair
|  d6 | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|:---:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-3 | **Apathy.** The character has disadvantage on death saving throws and on Dexterity checks for initiative, and gains the following flaw: "I don't believe I can make a difference to anyone or anything." |
| 4-5 | **Dread.** The character has disadvantage on all saving throws and gains the following flaw: "I am convinced that this place is going to kill me."                                                       |
|  6  | **Madness.** The character has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws that use Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, and gains the following flaw: "I can't tell what's real anymore."            |

If a character is already suffering a despair effect and fails the saving throw, the new despair effect replaces the old one. After finishing a long rest, a character can attempt to overcome the despair with a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. (The DC is higher because it's harder to shake off despair once it has taken hold.) On a successful save, the despair effect ends for that character.

A *calm emotions* spell removes despair, as does any spell or other magical effect that removes a curse.

#### Outer Planes: Psychic Dissonance

Each of the Outer Planes emanates a psychic dissonance that affects visitors of an incompatible alignment—good creatures on the Lower Planes, evil ones on the Upper Planes—if they spend too much time on the plane. You can reflect this dissonance with this optional rule. At the end of a long rest spent on an incompatible plane, a visitor must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion. Incompatibility between lawful and chaotic alignments doesn't have the same effect, so Mechanus and Limbo lack this quality.

#### Mount Celestia: Blessed Beneficence

In contrast to the dissonance experienced by evil creatures here, good creatures are literally blessed by the pervasive beneficence of the plane. Creatures of good alignment gain the benefit of the *bless* spell as long as they remain on the plane. In addition, finishing a long rest on the plane grants a good creature the benefit of a *lesser restoration* spell.

#### Bytopia: Pervasive Goodwill

At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor that is neither lawful good nor neutral good must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to lawful good or neutral good (whichever is closer to the creature's current alignment). The change becomes permanent if the creature doesn't leave the plane within 1d4 days. Otherwise, the creature's alignment reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other than Bytopia. Casting the *dispel evil and good* spell on the creature also restores its original alignment.

#### Elysium: Overwhelming Joy

Visitors spending any time on this plane risk becoming trapped by overwhelming sensations of contentment and happiness. At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is unwilling to leave the plane before taking another long rest. After three failed saving throws, the creature never willingly leaves the plane and, if forcibly removed, does everything in its power to return to the plane. A *dispel evil and good* spell removes this effect from the creature.

#### The Beastlands: Hunter's Paradise

Visitors to the Beastlands find their hunting and stalking capabilities improved, and characters have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling), Wisdom (Perception), and Wisdom (Survival) checks while there.

#### The Beastlands: Beast Transformation

Whenever a visitor slays a beast native to the plane, the slayer must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or become transformed (as the *polymorph* spell) into the type of beast that was slain. In this form, the creature retains its intelligence and ability to speak. At the end of each long rest, the polymorphed creature can repeat the saving throw. On a successful saving throw, the creature returns to its true form. After three failed saving throws. the transformation can be undone only by a *remove curse* spell or similar magic.

#### Arborea: Intense Yearning

Keep track of how many days a visitor spends on Arborea. When the visitor leaves, it must make a Charisma saving throw against a DC of 5, plus 1 for each day spent on the plane. On a failed save, the creature becomes afflicted with a yearning to return to Arborea. As long as the effect persists the creature has disadvantage on ability checks. At the end of each long rest, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. A *dispel evil and good* spell removes this effect from the creature.

#### Ysgard: Immortal Wrath

Ysgard is the home of slain heroes who wage eternal battle on fields of glory. Any creature, other than a construct or undead, that is killed by an attack or a spell while on Ysgard is restored to life at dawn the next day. The creature has all its hit points restored, and all conditions and afflictions it suffered before its death are removed.

#### Limbo: Power of the Mind

As an action, a creature on Limbo can make an Intelligence check to mentally move an object on the plane that it can see within 30 feet of it. The DC depends on the object's size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for Small, DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 for Huge or larger. On a successful check, the creature moves the object 5 feet plus 1 foot for every point by which it beat the DC.

A creature can also use an action to make an Intelligence check to alter a nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried. The same rules for distance apply, and the DC is based on the object's size: DC 10 for Tiny, DC 15 for Small, DC 20 for Medium, and DC 25 for Large or larger. On a success, the creature changes the object into another nonliving form of the same size, such as turning a boulder into a ball of fire.

Finally, a creature can use an action to make an Intelligence check to stabilize a spherical area centered on the creature. The DC depends on the radius of the sphere. The base DC is 5 for a 10-foot-radius sphere; each additional 10 feet added to the radius increases the DC by 5. On a successful check, the creature prevents the area from being altered by the plane for 24 hours, or until the creature uses this ability again.

#### Pandemonium: Mad Winds

A visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw after each hour spent among the howling winds. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion. A creature that reaches six levels of exhaustion while on this plane doesn't die. Instead, the creature gains a random form of indefinite madness, as described in chapter 8, "Running the Game." Finishing a long rest doesn't reduce a creature's exhaustion level unless the creature can somehow escape the maddening winds.

#### The Abyss: Abyssal Corruption

A non-evil visitor that finishes a long rest in the Abyss must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature becomes corrupted. Refer to the Abyssal Corruption table to determine the effects of this corruption. You can substitute different corruption effects of your own creation.

After finishing a long rest, a corrupted creature can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the corruption effect ends. A *dispel evil and good* spell or any magic that removes a curse also ends the effect.

If a corrupted creature doesn't leave the plane within 1d4 + 2 days, its alignment changes to chaotic evil. Casting the *dispel evil and good* spell on the creature restores its original alignment.

##### Abyssal Corruption
| d10 | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|:---:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1-4 | **Treachery.** The character gains the following flaw: "I can only achieve my goals by making sure that my companions don't achieve theirs."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 8-9 | **Mad Ambition.** The character gains the following flaw: "I am destined to rule the Abyss, and my companions are tools to that end."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  10 | **Demonic Possession.** The character is possessed by a demonic entity until freed by *dispel evil and good* or similar magic. Whenever the possessed character rolls a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, the demon takes control of the character and determines the character's behavior. At the end of each of the possessed character's turns, he or she can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a success, the character regains control until he or she rolls another 1. |

#### Carceri: Prison Plane

No one can leave Carceri easily. Magical efforts to leave the plane by any spell other than a wish simply fail.

Portals and gates that open onto the plane become one-way only. Secret ways out of the plane exist, but they are hidden and well guarded by traps and deadly monsters

#### Hades: Vile Transformation

At the end of each long rest taken on the plane, a visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of exhaustion, which can't be removed while the creature remains in Hades. If the creature reaches six levels of exhaustion, it doesn't die. Instead, the creature permanently transforms into a larva, whereupon all levels of exhaustion afflicting the creature are removed.

A larva is a miserable fiend that retains the facial features of its previous form but has the body of a fat worm. A larva has only a few faint memories of its previous life and the statistics in the **larva** stat block. Hades is crawling with larvae. Night hags, liches, and rakshasas harvest them for use in vile rituals. Other fiends like to feed on them.

#### Gehenna: Cruel Hindrance

The plane's cruel nature makes it difficult for visitors to help one another. Whenever a visitor casts a spell with a beneficial effect, including a spell that restores hit points or removes a condition, the caster must first make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the spell fails, the spell slot is expended, and the action is wasted.

#### The Nine Hells: Pervasive Evil

Evil pervades the Nine Hells, and visitors to this plane feel its influence. At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor that isn't evil must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to lawful evil. The change becomes permanent if the creature doesn't leave the plane within 1d4 days. Otherwise, the creature's alignment reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other than the Nine Hells. Casting the *dispel evil and good* spell on the creature also restores its original alignment.

#### Acheron: Bloodlust

Acheron rewards a creature for harming other creatures by imbuing that creature with the strength to keep fighting. While on Acheron, a creature gains temporary hit points equal to half its hit point maximum whenever it reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points.

#### Mechanus: Law of Averages

While on Mechanus, creatures always use the average damage result for attacks and spells. For example, an attack that normally deals 1d10 + 5 damage always deals 10 damage on Mechanus.

#### Mechanus: Imposing Order

At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor that isn't lawful neutral must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to lawful neutral. The creature's alignment reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other than Mechanus. Casting the *dispel evil and good* spell on the creature also restores its original alignment.

#### Arcadia: Planar Vitality

While on this plane, creatures can't be frightened or poisoned, and they are immune to disease and poisons.

## Loyalty

Loyalty is an optional rule you can use to determine how far an NPC party member will go to protect or assist the other members of the party (even those she doesn't particularly like). An NPC party member who is abused or ignored is likely to abandon the party, whereas an NPC who owes a life characters or shares their goals might fight to the death for them. Loyalty can be roleplayed or represented by this rule.

#### Loyalty Score

An NPC's loyalty is measured on a numerical scale from 0 to 20. The NPC's maximum loyalty score is equal to the highest Charisma score among all adventurers in the party, and its starting loyalty score is half that number. If the highest Charisma score changes—perhaps a character dies or leaves the group-adjust the NPC's loyalty score accordingly.

#### Tracking Loyalty

Keep track of an NPC's loyalty score in secret so that the players won't know for sure whether an NPC party member is loyal or disloyal (even if the NPC is currently under a player's control).

An NPC's loyalty score increases by 1d4 if other party members help the NPC achieve a goal tied to its bond. Likewise, an NPC's loyalty score increases by 1d4 if the NPC is treated particularly well (for example, given a magic weapon as a gift) or rescued by another party member. An NPC's loyalty score can never be raised above its maximum.

When other party members act in a manner that runs counter to the NPC's alignment or bond, reduce the PC's loyalty score by 1d4. Reduce the NPC's loyalty score by 2d4 if the character is abused, misled, or endangered by other party members for purely selfish reasons.

An NPC whose loyalty score drops to 0 is no longer loyal to the party and might part ways with them. A loyalty score can never drop below 0.

An NPC with a loyalty score of 10 or higher risks life and limb to help fellow party members. If the NPC's loyalty score is between 1 and 10, its loyalty is tenuous. An NPC whose loyalty drops to 0 no longer acts in the party's best interests. The disloyal NPC either leaves the party (attacking characters who attempt to intervene) or works in secret to bring about the party's downfall.

## More Difficult Identification

If you prefer magic items to have a greater mystique, consider removing the ability to identify the properties of a magic item during a short rest, and require the *identify* spell, experimentation, or both to reveal what a magic item does.

---

## Mixing Potions

A character might drink one potion while still under the effects of another, or pour several potions into a single container. The strange ingredients used in creating potions can result in unpredictable interactions.

When a character mixes two potions together, you can roll on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are combined, roll again for each subsequent potion, combining the results. Unless the effects are immediately obvious, reveal them only when they become evident.

##### Potion Miscibility

At your discretion, an appropriate spell, such as *dispel magic* or *remove curse*, might end this lasting effect. |

## Wands That Don't Recharge

A typical wand has expendable charges. If you'd like wands to be a limited resource, you can make some of them incapable of regaining charges. Consider increasing the base number of charges in such a wand, to a maximum of 25 charges. These charges are never regained once they're expended.

---

## Automatic Success

Sometimes the randomness of a d20 roll leads to ludicrous results. Let's say a door requires a DC 15 Strength check to batter down. A fighter with Strength 20 might helplessly flail against the door due to bad die rolls. Meanwhile, the rogue with a 10 Strength rolls a natural 20 on her first check and knocks the door from its hinges.

If such results bother you, allow automatic success on checks for characters with high ability scores. Under this optional rule, a character automatically succeeds on any ability check with a DC less than or equal to the relevant ability score minus 5. So in the above example, the fighter would automatically kick in the door. This rule doesn't apply to contests, saving throws, or attack rolls.

The downside of this approach is its predictability. Once a character's ability score reaches 20, checks of DC 15 and lower using that ability become automatic successes. Smart players will then always try to match the character with the highest ability score against any given check. If you want some risk of failure, you need to set higher DCs. Doing this, though, can merely aggravate the problem you're trying to solve: higher DCs require higher die rolls, and thus rely even more on luck.

You can modify this rule to account for proficiencies using an additional option. If a character can apply a proficiency bonus to the check, he or she automatically succeeds if its DC is less than or equal to the relevant ability score. If you don't mind predictability, and you can resist the temptation to increase DCs, you might find that this variant speeds up play and focuses attention on truly difficult, tense situations.

## Madness

In a typical campaign, characters aren't driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.

#### Going Mad

Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as *contact other plane* and *symbol*, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects in the *Player's Handbook*. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.

Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. If your game includes the Sanity score (see chapter 9, "Dungeon Master's Workshop"), a creature makes a Sanity saving throw instead.

#### Madness Effects

Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness.

A character afflicted with **short-term madness** is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d10 minutes.

A character afflicted with **long-term madness** is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 × 10 hours.

A character afflicted with **indefinite madness** gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.

##### Short-Term Madness

|  21-30 | The character suffers extreme paranoia. The character has disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma checks.                                                                                                                                |
|  31-40 | The character regards something (usually the source of madness) with intense revulsion, as if affected by the antipathy effect of the *antipathy/sympathy* spell.                                                                    |
|  41-45 | The character experiences a powerful delusion. Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or she is under its effects.                                                                                                          |
|  46-55 | The character becomes attached to a "lucky charm," such as a person or an object, and has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while more than 30 feet from it.                                           |
|  56-65 | The character is blinded (25%) or deafened (75%).                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  66-75 | The character experiences uncontrollable tremors or tics, which impose disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that involve Strength or Dexterity.                                                           |
|  76-85 | The character suffers from partial amnesia. The character knows who he or she is and retains racial traits and class features, but doesn't recognize other people or remember anything that happened before the madness took effect. |
|  86-90 | Whenever the character takes damage, he or she must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as though he or she failed a saving throw against the *confusion* spell. The confusion effect lasts for 1 minute.          |
|  91-95 | The character loses the ability to speak.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 96-100 | The character falls unconscious. No amount of jostling or damage can wake the character.                                                                                                                                             |

##### Indefinite Madness

|  16-25 | "I keep whatever I find."                                                                                                                |
|  26-30 | "I try to become more like someone else I know—adopting his or her style of dress, mannerisms, and name."                                |
|  31-35 | "I must bend the truth, exaggerate, or outright lie to be interesting to other people."                                                  |
|  36-45 | "Achieving my goal is the only thing of interest to me, and I'll ignore everything else to pursue it."                                   |

|  51-55 | "I don't like the way people judge me all the time."                                                                                     |
|  56-70 | "I am the smartest, wisest, strongest, fastest, and most beautiful person I know."                                                       |
|  71-80 | "I am convinced that powerful enemies are hunting me, and their agents are everywhere I go. I am sure they're watching me all the time." |
|  81-85 | "There's only one person I can trust. And only I can see this special friend."                                                           |
|  86-95 | "I can't take anything seriously. The more serious the situation, the funnier I find it."                                                |
| 96-100 | "I've discovered that I really like killing people."                                                                                     |

#### Curing Madness

A *calm emotions* spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a *lesser restoration* spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, *remove curse* or *dispel evil* might also prove effective. A *greater restoration* spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness.

## Proficiency Dice

This optional rule replaces a character's proficiency bonus with a proficiency die, adding more randomness to the game and making proficiency a less reliable indicator of mastery. Instead of adding a proficiency bonus to an ability check, an attack roll, or saving throw, the character's player rolls a die. The Proficiency Die table shows which die or dice to roll, as determined by the character's level.

Whenever a feature, such as the rogue's Expertise, lets a character double his or her proficiency bonus, the player rolls the character's proficiency die twice instead of once.

This option is intended for player characters and nonplayer characters who have levels, as opposed to monsters who don't.

##### Proficiency Dice
|   Level   | Proficiency Bonus | Proficiency Die |
|:---------:|:-----------------:|:---------------:|
|  1st-4th  |         +2        |       1d4       |
|  5th-8th  |         +3        |       1d6       |
|  9th-12th |         +4        |       1d8       |
| 13th-16th |         +5        |       1d10      |
| 17th-20th |         +6        |       1d12      |

## New Ability Scores: Honor and Sanity

If you're running a campaign shaped by a strict code of honor or the constant risk of insanity, consider adding one or both these new ability scores: Honor and Sanity.

These abilities function like the standard six abilities, with exceptions specified in each ability below.

Here's how to incorporate these optional abilities at character creation:

- If your players use the standard array of ability scores, add one 11 to the array for each optional ability you add.
- If your players use the optional point-buy system, add 3 points to the number of points for each optional ability you add.
- If your players roll their ability scores, have them roll for the added ability scores.

If you ever need to make a check or saving throw for Honor or Sanity for a monster that lacks the score, you can use Charisma for Honor and Wisdom for Sanity.

#### Honor Score

If your campaign involves cultures where a rigid code of honor is part of daily life, consider using the Honor score as a means of measuring a character's devotion to that code. This ability fits well in a setting inspired by Asian cultures, such as Kara-Tur in the Forgotten Realms. The Honor ability is also useful in any campaign that revolves around orders of knights.

Honor measures not only a character's devotion to a code but also the character's understanding of it. The Honor score can also reflect how others perceive a character's honor. A character with a high Honor usually has a reputation that others know about, especially those who have high Honor scores themselves.

Unlike other abilities, Honor can't be raised with normal ability score increases. Instead, you can award increases to Honor—or impose reductions—based on a character's actions. At the end of an adventure, if you think a character's actions in the adventure reflected well or poorly on his or her understanding of the code, you can increase or decrease the character's Honor by 1. As with other ability scores, a character's Honor can't exceed 20 or fall below 1.

***Honor Checks.*** Honor checks can be used in social situations, much as Charisma would, when a character's understanding of a code of conduct is the most defining factor in the way a social interaction will play out. You might also call for an Honor check when a character is in one of the following situations:

- Being unsure how to act with honor
- Surrendering while trying to save face
- Trying to determine another character's Honor score
- Trying to use the proper etiquette in a delicate social situation
- Using his or her honorable or dishonorable reputation to influence someone else

***Honor Saving Throws.*** An Honor saving throw comes into play when you want to determine whether a character might inadvertently do something dishonorable. You might call for an Honor saving throw in the following situations:

- Avoiding an accidental breach of honor or etiquette
- Resisting the urge to respond to goading or insults from an enemy
- Recognizing when an enemy attempts to trick a character into a breach of honor

#### Sanity Score

Consider using the Sanity score if your campaign revolves around entities of an utterly alien and unspeakable nature, such as Great Cthulhu, whose powers and minions can shatter a character's mind.

A character with a high Sanity is level-headed even in the face of insane circumstances, while a character with low Sanity is unsteady, breaking easily when confronted by eldritch horrors that are beyond normal reason.

***Sanity Checks.*** You might ask characters to make a Sanity check in place of an Intelligence check to recall lore about the alien creatures of madness featured in your campaign, to decipher the writings of raving lunatics, or to learn spells from tomes of forbidden lore. You might also call for a Sanity check when a character tries one of the following activities:

- Deciphering a piece of text written in a language so alien that it threatens to break a character's mind
- Overcoming the lingering effects of madness
- Comprehending a piece of alien magic foreign to all normal understanding of magic

***Sanity Saving Throws.*** You might call for a Sanity saving throw when a character runs the risk of succumbing to madness, such as in the following situations:

- Seeing a creature from the Far Realm or other alien realms for the first time
- Making direct contact with the mind of an alien creature
- Being subjected to spells that affect mental stability, such as the insanity option of the *symbol* spell
- Passing through a demiplane built on alien physics
- Resisting an effect conferred by an attack or spell that deals psychic damage

A failed Sanity save might result in short-term, long-term, or indefinite madness, as described in chapter 8, "Running the Game." Any time a character suffers from long-term or indefinite madness, the character's Sanity is reduced by 1. A *greater restoration* spell can restore Sanity lost in this way, and a character can increase his or her Sanity through level advancement.

## Fear and Horror

The rules for fear and horror can help you sustain an atmosphere of dread in a dark fantasy campaign.

#### Fear

When adventurers confront threats they have no hope of overcoming, you can call for them to make a Wisdom saving throw. Set the DC according to the circumstances. A character who fails the save becomes frightened for 1 minute. The character can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of his or her turns, ending the effect on the character on a successful save.

#### Horror

Horror involves more than simple fright. It entails revulsion and anguish. Often it arises when adventurer see something completely contrary to the common understanding of what can and should occur in the world, or upon the realization of a dreadful truth.

In such a situation, you can call on characters to make a Charisma saving throw to resist the horror. Set the DC based on the magnitude of the horrific circumstances. On a failed save, a character gains a short-term or long-term form of madness that you choose or determine randomly, as detailed in chapter 8, "Running the Game."

---

## Healing

These optional rules make it easier or harder for adventurers to recover from injury, either increasing or reducing the amount of time your players can spend adventuring before rest is required.

#### Healer's Kit Dependency

A character can't spend any Hit Dice after finishing a short rest until someone expends one use of a healer's kit to bandage and treat the character's wounds.

#### Healing Surges

This optional rule allows characters to heal up in the thick of combat and works well for parties that feature few or no characters with healing magic, or for campaigns in which magical healing is rare.

As an action, a character can use a healing surge and spend up to half his or her Hit Dice. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.

A character who uses a healing surge can't do so again until he or she finishes a short or long rest. Under this optional rule, a character regains all spent Hit Dice at the end of a long rest. With a short rest, a character regains Hit Dice equal to his or her level divided by four (minimum of one dice).

For a more superheroic feel, you can let a character use a healing surge as a bonus action, rather than as an action.

#### Slow Natural Healing

Characters don't regain hit points at the end of a long rest. Instead, a character can spend Hit Dice to heal at the end of a long rest, just as with a short rest.

This optional rule prolongs the amount of time that characters need to recover from their wounds without the benefits of magical healing and works well for grittier, more realistic campaigns.

## Action Options

This section provides new action options for combat. They can be added as a group or individually to your game.

#### Climb onto a Bigger Creature

If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it can do so by grappling. A small or Medium creature has little chance of making a successful grapple against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic has granted the grappler supernatural might.

As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the target's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature's space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.

The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's location, and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it—by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the smaller creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.

#### Disarm

A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.

The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.

#### Mark

This option makes it easier for melee combatants to harry each other with opportunity attacks.

When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn, any opportunity attack it makes against the marked target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't expend the attacker's reaction, but the attacker can't make the attack if anything, such as the incapacitated condition or the *shocking grasp* spell, is preventing it from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one opportunity attack per turn.

#### Overrun

When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature's space, the mover can try to force its way through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the hostile creature's Strength (Athletics) check. The creature attempting the overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If the mover wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.

#### Shove Aside

With this option, a creature uses the special shove attack from the *Player's Handbook* to force a target to the side, rather than away. The attacker has disadvantage on its Strength (Athletics) check when it does so. If that check is successful, the attacker moves the target 5 feet to a different space within its reach.

#### Tumble

A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the hostile creature's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the tumbler wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.

---

## Injuries

Damage normally leaves no lingering effects. This option introduces the potential for long-term injuries.

It's up to you to decide when to check for a lingering injury. A creature might sustain a lingering injury under the following circumstances:

- When it takes a critical hit
- When it drops to 0 hit points but isn't killed outright
- When it fails a death saving throw by 5 or more

To determine the nature of the injury, roll on the Lingering Injuries table. This table assumes a typical humanoid physiology, but you can adapt the results for creatures with different body types.

##### Lingering Injuries
|  d20  | Injury                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|:-----:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   1   | **Lose an Eye.** You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight and on ranged attack rolls. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost eye. If you have no eyes left after sustaining this injury, you're blinded.                                                                                      |
|   2   | **Lose an Arm or a Hand.** You can no longer hold anything with two hands, and you can hold only a single object at a time. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost appendage.                                                                                                                                               |
|   3   | **Lose a Foot or Leg.** Your speed on foot is halved, and you must use a cane or crutch to move unless you have a peg leg or other prosthesis. You fall prone after using the Dash action. You have disadvantage on Dexterity checks made to balance. Magic such as the *regenerate* spell can restore the lost appendage.                     |
|   4   | **Limp.** Your speed on foot is reduced by 5 feet. You must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw after using the Dash action. If you fail the save, you fall prone. Magical healing removes the limp.                                                                                                                                           |
|  5-7  | **Internal Injury.** Whenever you attempt an action in combat, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you lose your action and can't use reactions until the start of your next turn. The injury heals if you receive magical healing or if you spend ten days doing nothing but resting.                          |
|  8-10 | **Broken Ribs.** This has the same effect as Internal Injury above, except that the save DC is 10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 11-13 | **Horrible Scar.** You are disfigured to the extent that the wound can't be easily concealed. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks and advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as *heal* and *regenerate*, removes the scar.                                                |
| 14-16 | **Festering Wound.** Your hit point maximum is reduced by 1 every 24 hours the wound persists. If your hit point maximum drops to 0, you die. The wound heals if you receive magical healing. Alternatively, someone can tend to the wound and make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check once every 24 hours. After ten successes, the wound heals. |
| 17-20 | **Minor Scar.** The scar doesn't have any adverse effect. Magical healing of 6th level or higher, such as *heal* and *regenerate*, removes the scar.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Instead of using the effect described in the table, you can put the responsibility of representing a character's lingering injury in the hands of the player. Roll on the Lingering Injuries table as usual, but instead of suffering the effect described for that result, that character gains a new flaw with the same name. It's up to the player to express the lingering injury during play, just like any other flaw, with the potential to gain inspiration when the injury affects the character in a meaningful way.

## Massive Damage

This optional rule makes it easier for a creature to be felled by massive damage.

When a creature takes damage from a single source equal to or greater than half its hit point maximum, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer a random effect determined by a roll on the System Shock table. For example, a creature that has a hit point maximum of 30 must make that Constitution save if it takes 15 damage or more from a single source.

##### System Shock
|  d10 | Effect                                                                                                                    |

|  2-3 | The creature drops to 0 hit points but is stable.                                                                         |
|  4-5 | The creature is stunned until the end of its next turn.                                                                   |
|  6-7 | The creature can't take reactions and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. |
| 8-10 | The creature can't take reactions until the end of its next turn.                                                         |

## Morale

Some combatants might run away when a fight turns against them. You can use this optional rule to help determine when monsters and NPCs flee.

A creature might flee under any of the following circumstances:

- The creature is surprised.
- The creature is reduced to half its hit points or fewer for the first time in the battle.
- The creature has no way to harm the opposing side on its turn.

A group of creatures might flee under any of the following circumstances:

- All the creatures in the group are surprised.
- The group's leader is reduced to 0 hit points, incapacitated, taken prisoner, or removed from battle.
- The group is reduced to half its original size with no losses on the opposing side.

To determine whether a creature or group of creatures flees, make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw for the creature or the group's leader. If the opposition is overwhelming, the saving throw is made with disadvantage, or you can decide that the save fails automatically. If a group's leader can't make the saving throw for whatever reason, have the creature in the group with the next highest Charisma score make the saving throw instead.

On a failed save, the affected creature or group flees by the most expeditious route. If escape is impossible, the creature or group surrenders. If a creature or group that surrenders is attacked by its conquerors, the battle might resume, and it's unlikely that further attempts to flee or surrender will be made.

A failed saving throw isn't always to the adventurers' benefit. For example, an ogre that flees from combat might put the rest of the dungeon on alert or run off with treasure that the characters had hoped to plunder.

## Spell Points

One way to modify how a class feels is to change how it uses its spells. With this variant system, a character who has the Spellcasting feature uses spell points instead spell slots to fuel spells. Spell points give a caster more flexibility, at the cost of greater complexity.

In this variant, each spell has a point cost based on its level. The Spell Point Cost table summarizes the cost in spell points of slots from 1st to 9th level. Cantrips don't require slots and therefore don't require spell points.

Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast your spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool of spell points instead. You expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell points total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.

Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can use spell points to create one slot of each level of 6th or higher. You can't create another slot of the same level until you finish a long rest.

The number of spell points you have to spend is based on your level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Spell Points by Level table. Your level also determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so.

The Spell Points by Level table applies to bards, clerics, druids, sorcerers, and wizards. For a paladin or ranger, halve the character's level in that class and then consult the table. For a fighter (Eldritch Knight) or rogue (Arcane Trickster), divide the character's level in that class by three.

This system can be applied to monsters that cast spells using spell slots, but it isn't recommended that you do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a monster can be a hassle.

##### Spell Point Cost
| Spell Level | Point Cost |
|:-----------:|:----------:|
|     1st     |      2     |
|     2nd     |      3     |

## Ship Stat Blocks

To aid in running adventures where ships engage in combat, undertake precise navigation, or face situations where their various capabilities become relevant, the following section presents new rules and stat blocks for a spectrum of vessels.

#### Basic Statistics

A ship stat block has three main parts: basic statistics, components, and action options. Ships can't take any actions on their own. Without effort from its crew, a ship might drift on the water, come to a stop, or careen out of control.

***Size.*** Most ships are Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. A ship's size category is determined by its length or width, whichever is longer. For instance, a ship that is 10 feet long and 20 feet wide would use the size category that has a 20-foot width, which means the ship is Gargantuan.

***Space.*** A ship doesn't have a square space unless its stat block specifies otherwise. For example, a ship that is 20 feet long and 10 feet wide occupies a 20-by-10-foot space.

A ship can't move into a space that is too small to accommodate it. If it tries to do so, it crashes, as described in the "Crashing a Ship" section.

***Capacity.*** A ship's stat block indicates how many creatures and how much cargo it can carry. Creatures include both the crew of the vessel and any passengers who might ride along. Passengers don't generally engage in running a ship, but they also don't need to be mere bystanders. Seasick merchants and marines thoroughly capable of facing menaces from the deep both count as passengers.

Cargo capacity notes the maximum amount of cargo a ship can carry. A vessel can't move—or might even start taking on water—if its cargo exceeds this capacity.

***Travel Pace.*** A ship's travel pace determines how far the vessel can move per hour and per day. A ship's movement-related components (described later in the stat block) determine how far the vessel can move each round.

***Ability Scores.*** A ship has the six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and the corresponding modifiers.

The Strength of a ship expresses its size and weight. Dexterity represents a ship's ease of handling. A ship's Constitution covers its durability and the quality of its construction. Ships usually have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

If a ship has a 0 in a score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that uses that score.

***Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities.*** A ship's vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities apply to all its components, unless otherwise noted in the stat block.

Ships are typically immune to poison and psychic damage. Ships are also usually immune to the following conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, stunned, and unconscious.

#### Actions

This part of the stat block specifies what the ship can do on its turn, using its special actions rather than the actions used by creatures. It even relies on its actions to move; it doesn't have a move otherwise. The ship's captain decides which actions to use. A given action can be chosen only once during a turn.

#### Components

A ship is composed of different components, each of which comprises multiple objects:

**Hull**. A ship's hull is its basic frame, on which the other components are mounted.

**Control**. A control component is used to steer a ship.

**Movement**. A movement component is the element of the ship that enables it to move, such as a set of sails or oars, and has a specific speed.

**Weapon**. A ship capable of being used in combat has one or more weapon components, each of which is operated separately.

A ship's component might have special rules, as described in the stat block.

***Armor Class.*** A component has an Armor Class. Its AC reflects the materials used to construct it and any defensive plating used to augment its toughness.

***Hit Points.*** A ship component is destroyed and becomes unusable when it drops to 0 hit points. A ship is wrecked if its hull is destroyed.

A ship doesn't have Hit Dice.

***Damage Threshold.*** If a ship component has a damage threshold, that threshold appears after its hit points. A component has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage that equals or exceeds its threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Damage that fails to bypass the threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the component's hit points.

#### Sample Ships

See the [vehicles.html](vehicles page) for stat blocks, deck plans, and other details for some of the most common ships.

- Galley
- Keelboat
- Longship
- Rowboat
- Sailing Ship
- Warship

> ##### Siege Weapons
>
>Some ships are armed with siege weapons, the descriptions of which are in the "*Siege Equipment*" section of chapter 8 in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. In this appendix, the name of a piece of siege equipment appears in bold with a parenthetical note (*DMG, ch. 8*), reminding you where to find the object's description.

## Superior Ship Upgrades

Some vessels possess extraordinary abilities, whether due to magic or superior artisanship. The upgrades below can replace a ship's existing components or provide a new element to augment a ship's abilities.

Adding an upgrade costs 15,000 gp and requires 1d4 weeks of work. During that time, the ship must remain in port. If the ship leaves, the work must start over, but you don't need to pay the gold piece cost a second time.

#### Hull Upgrades

Any ship with a hull can gain one of the following upgrades. In some cases, an upgrade also provides a benefit to the ship's other components.

- Churning Hull
- Death Vessel
- Frost-Locked Hull
- Living Vessel
- Reinforced Hull
- Vigilant Watch

#### Movement Upgrades

Each movement upgrade applies to a specific movement type. A component can gain the benefits of one upgrade.

- Clockwork Oars
- Ever-Full Sails
- Defiant Sails
- Dragon Sails
- Screaming Sails
- Scything Oars

#### Weapon Upgrades

The following upgrades can apply to any weapon mounted aboard a ship. A component can gain the benefits of one upgrade, or two upgrades if one of the upgrades is Arcane Artillery.

- Arcane Artillery
- Concussive Rounds
- Explosive Rounds
- Grasping Rounds

#### Figurehead Upgrades

While figureheads are usually purely decorative, they might be magically treated to produce extraordinary effects. A ship can receive one figurehead upgrade.

- Guardian Figurehead
- Red Dragon Figurehead
- Storm Giant Figurehead

#### Miscellaneous Upgrades

The following upgrades don't apply to a specific element of the ship. A ship can use any number of them, but it can gain a specific upgrade only once.

- Bones of Endless Toil
- Smuggler's Banner
- Taskmaster's Drums

## Ocean Environs

For those who dwell on land, the sea is an alien world filled with unpredictable hazards. Yet rare treasures hide in the depths, making such dangers well worth the risk for brave and brazen mariners. This section details a variety of environmental features one might encounter both on and beneath the waves.

#### Blue Holes

A blue hole is a circular sinkhole that forms on the bed of the sea in shallow water. The deep blue water of the hole creates a stark contrast with the lighter color of the shallow water that surrounds it. Blue holes have diameters of 1d10 × 100 feet and are 1d10 × 100 feet deep.

Blue holes are filled with secrets. Many blue holes hide monsters or treasure, as shown on the Hiding in Blue Holes table.

##### Hiding in Blue Holes

#### Coral Reefs

Coral reefs grow all over the ocean floor, though most are found within depths of less than 150 feet near the shoreline. Reefs range from a few feet to over 1,000 miles in length and width. These colorful ecosystems house small fish, crustaceans, and mollusks. As a result, predators come to reefs looking for prey.

Uneven and sharp, coral reefs can harm those forced into them. A creature forcibly moved on the reef—without using the creature's action, bonus action, or reaction—takes 3 (1d6) slashing damage per 5 feet of reef that it is pushed over.

#### Currents

Ocean water is moved by wind and tides to create constant river-like flows called currents. Tidal currents are typically the strongest. They're usually found within 50 miles of shore and at depths of less than 300 feet. These currents have a speed of 1d6 miles per hour that changes daily.

Currents become weaker farther out to sea and deeper in the ocean. These currents have a speed of 1d4−1 miles per hour that changes daily.

![](img/variantrules/GoS/096-za-06-ocean-environs-p203.webp)

***Currents and Travel.*** When a vessel or creature travels in the same direction as a current, that current's speed is added to the vessel or creature's travel pace. A creature or vessel traveling against a current has that current's speed subtracted from the vessel or creature's travel pace. If this results in a negative travel pace, the vessel or creature can let the current carry it. Alternatively, the crew of the vessel or the creature can fight against the current by rowing or swimming hard, moving at half the vessel or creature's normal pace. Vessels and creatures fighting against a current must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of every hour traveled, with a bonus equal to the crew's quality (if they have crew). Vessels that fail have their crew's quality score decreased by 1. Creatures that fail gain one level of exhaustion. The DC for this saving throw is 10 + 1 for every consecutive hour spent fighting the current.

***Submerged in Currents.*** When a creature without a swimming speed is submerged in a current, the creature must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check at the end of its turn or get pulled 1d4 × 5 feet in the direction of the current. The DC for this check equals 10 + the number of miles per hour the current is moving.

#### Depth

The deeper a surface-dwelling creature travels into the sea, the more hostile the environment becomes. Those venturing into the depths must keep the following natural forces in mind.

***Illumination.*** When it comes to light, the sea is divided into three layers:

**Sunlight Zone**. The sunlight zone extends from the water's surface to a depth of 650 feet. This area of the sea has the same natural illumination conditions as above the water.

**Twilight Zone**. The twilight zone is between the depths of 650 and 1,000 feet. When the sunlight zone above is bathed in natural bright light, the twilight zone is filled with dim light. If the sunlight zone is filled with dim light or darkness, the twilight zone is dark.

**Midnight Zone**. Any depth below 1,000 feet is considered the midnight zone, since no natural light from the surface penetrates this deep.

***Pressure and Temperature.*** Water pressure, or the weight of water on top of a creature or object, increases with depth. Conversely, temperature decreases as depth increases. The pressure and temperature's effects on creatures without a swimming speed at depths below 100 feet can be found in the "*Unusual Environments*" section in chapter 5 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*.

***Optional Rule: Pressure and Objects.*** With this optional rule, characters who dive deep in the ocean require specialized equipment that can withstand the ocean's pressure. Nonmagical objects not made to withstand the water pressure are destroyed at various depths, as determined by the material used to create them. This destructive depth is presented for various materials on the Objects and Water Pressure table. Objects made of other materials break at the DM's discretion.

##### Objects and Water Pressure
| Material            | Destructive Depth |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Glass, crystal, ice | 100 ft.           |
| Wood, bone          | 500 ft.           |
| Stone               | 1,000 ft.         |
| Iron, steel         | 1,500 ft.         |
| Mithral             | 2,000 ft.         |
| Adamantine          | 2,500 ft.         |

#### Eldritch Mist

While natural fog on the ocean can be a nuisance to ship crews, eldritch mist strikes fear into sailors everywhere. These rare, mysterious mists are almost indistinguishable from the naturally occurring variety until it's too late.

If a ship encounters eldritch mist, choose a type or roll for one on the Eldritch Mist Types table.

##### Eldritch Mist Types
|  d6 | Mist Type      |
|:---:|----------------|
| 1–2 | Ghost Fog      |
| 3–4 | Shadowfell Fog |
| 5–6 | Wild Magic Fog |

***Mist Thickness.*** Mist lightly obscures the area it fills. Depending on its density, it heavily obscures an area beyond a certain distance from creatures within. Use the Mist Thickness table to determine a mist's thickness at random. The Mist Obfuscation table notes how far a creature in mist can see before the area beyond is heavily obscured.

##### Mist Thickness
| d10 | Thickness  |
|:---:|------------|
| 1–3 | Light      |
| 4–7 | Moderate   |
| 8–9 | Heavy      |
|  10 | Very Heavy |

##### Mist Obfuscation
| Thickness  | Heavily Obscured Distance |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Light      | 30 ft.                    |
| Moderate   | 20 ft.                    |
| Heavy      | 10 ft.                    |
| Very heavy | 5 ft.                     |

***Ghost Fog.*** Ghost fog contains the souls of murder victims whose bodies were thrown into the sea. A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that this mist is ghost fog.

The souls of the dead want the living to join them. Every hour a ship is immersed in ghost fog, roll any die. On an even number, 2d4 hostile **specters** appear and attack those on the ship. If a humanoid creature dies in ghost fog, its spirit rises as a specter that is hostile toward all creatures that aren't undead.

All non-undead creatures immersed in ghost fog are vulnerable to necrotic damage.

***Shadowfell Fog.*** Shadowfell fog seeps into the Material Plane at thin points in the boundary between the two planes. A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that this mist is Shadowfell fog.

When a vessel travels through this oppressive, shadow-haunted miasma, its crew and passengers feel despair. Each hour a vessel is immersed in the fog, the crew must make a quality score check by rolling a d20 and adding their quality score to the number. The DC for this check is 10 + the number of hours the ship has been immersed in the Shadowfell fog. If the crew fails this check, their quality score decreases by 1 while within the Shadowfell fog and for 1 day afterward.

***Wild Magic Fog.*** Few know the origins of wild magic fog, with some claiming it is the creation of capricious gods while others believe it is the result of magical experimentation gone wrong. A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that this mist is wild magic fog.

Whenever a creature in wild magic fog casts a spell of 1st level or higher, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table in chapter 3, "*Classes*," of the *Player's Handbook* to create a magical effect.

#### Kelp Forests

Kelp grows in dense forests across the ocean floor. Most forests are found within depths of less than 100 feet near the shoreline, and range from 10 feet to over 100 miles in length and width. The kelp grows in vines up to 175 feet in length.

Kelp roots are shallow, and a whole forest can be uprooted by a strong storm. But it grows at a rapid pace, sometimes as much as 18 inches a day, meaning that a kelp forest can spring up quickly. Such forests can hide thousands of small fish and other prey animals, which attract predators. The forest is so dense that anything within it is heavily obscured to an observer more than 10 feet away, and the whole area is difficult terrain.

#### Kraken's Grave

When krakens die, their bodies often rot on the seafloor. In such cases, the ground absorbs the decaying kraken's supernatural energy, marking the area with a dark stain in the shape of the kraken's body. This stain is called a kraken's grave.

When a creature moves within 30 feet of a kraken's grave or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check or it disturbs the grave. If a creature disturbs the grave, a tendril made of lightning stretches from the ground and attacks the creature with a +7 bonus to hit. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) lightning damage, and it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for the next 2d4 hours.

#### Lure Lights

When aboleths die, their souls sometimes gather in clusters called lure lights. These 100-foot-diameter collections of pale, yellow lights are found in the deep ocean below depths of 1,000 feet. They glow with bright light in a 100-foot radius and dim light for another 100 feet.

Any creature that can see the lure lights must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the lights for 24 hours or until the lights are destroyed. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the effect of the lure lights for 24 hours.

While charmed by the lights, a creature can't willingly move out of line of sight of them and defends them to the death. If forcibly moved away from the lights, the creature tries to find its way back to them. The creature can't take a short or long rest while under this effect. After 24 hours, the charmed creature gains one level of exhaustion and must repeat the saving throw if it is within line of sight of the lights, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the lights aren't within line of sight at this time, the creature succeeds automatically.

Each cluster of lure lights has AC 17, 100 hit points, and immunity to necrotic and poison damage.

#### Magical Storms

Even worse than the threat of storms is the menace of weather imbued with magic. When a ship enters a storm, roll a d20. On a 20, the storm churns with magical energy. Pick or randomly determine the type of magical energy brimming within the storm, consulting the Magical Storm Type table.

##### Magical Storm Type
|  d8 | Magic         |
|:---:|---------------|
|  1  | Abjuration    |
|  2  | Conjuration   |
|  3  | Divination    |
|  4  | Enchantment   |
|  5  | Evocation     |
|  6  | Illusion      |
|  7  | Necromancy    |
|  8  | Transmutation |

***Abjuration.*** A storm infused with abjuration magic repels ships, as if protecting something in the sea. Right before the storm ends, a ship within it is teleported 5d20 miles in a random direction.

***Conjuration.*** When conjuration magic churns within a storm's heart, creatures of wind and rain emerge from distant realms to attack anything they encounter. The ship encounters 1d3 hostile **air elementals**.

***Divination.*** When divination magic seeps into a storm, howling winds and residual whispers temporarily scramble the knowledge of a ship's crew; for 1d3 days, the ship's crew suffers disadvantage on all quality checks.

***Enchantment.*** Storms infused with enchantment magic disarm a creature's sense of danger, enthralling mariners and causing them to speed into danger. During the storm, any checks made to resolve hazards or manage the ship are made with disadvantage.

***Evocation.*** These ferocious storms are wracked with thunderbolts, driving sheets of acid rain, exploding meteors, and other dangers. After each day of the storm, every component aboard the ship takes 1d10 fire, 1d10 acid, and 1d10 lightning damage. In addition, roll a d20 and add the crew's quality. On a 10 or less, the crew's quality decreases by 1, and 1d6 members of the crew are killed.

***Illusion.*** A storm brimming with illusions poses little direct harm to a ship, but experienced navigators know it poses an insidious threat. During the storm, the ship travels in a random direction that isn't its intended course.

***Necromancy.*** Ghosts howl and whirl in this storm's wind, while the remains of long-dead mariners stir in their watery graves. During the storm, 1d4 **specters**, 2d4 **ghouls**, and 4d6 **zombies** emerge from the waves to attack the ship.

***Transmutation.*** These violently unpredictable storms cause the waves to warp and twist. The storm transforms the water around the ship into an amalgamation of ice, stone, and stranger materials, making travel difficult and damaging the ship. The ship's hull takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage, and the ship's speed decreases by half during the storm.

#### Sandbars

Waves and currents deposit sand in shallow water near the shoreline. These sandbars form a line that can be between 10 feet and 3 miles in length and width. During high tide, sandbars are below the ocean's surface, while they peek above the water during low tide.

***Navigating Sandbars.*** Sandbars make dangerous obstacles for vessels, particularly at high tide when they are less noticeable. The crew of a ship moving toward a sandbar beneath the waves must have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 12 or higher or fail to see the sandbar in the way (see "*Noticing Threats*"). When a ship passes over a submerged sandbar, the sandbar counts as difficult terrain, and the ship must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. The DC of this save corresponds with the depth of the sandbar, as listed on the Sandbar DCs table. If the ship fails this save, it gets stuck on the sandbar. A ship can become unstuck by using an action to make a Strength check, with a bonus equal to the crew's quality, against the sandbar's DC.

##### Sandbar DCs
|  DC | Description      |
|:---:|------------------|
|  10 | Deep sandbar     |
|  15 | Moderate sandbar |
|  20 | Shallow sandbar  |

#### Sapping Snow

Sapping snow—that's what aquatic explorers call the powdery remains of dead organisms that cover the ocean floor. When this substance is imbued with necromantic magic, it becomes a life-leeching detritus.

Whenever a creature starts its turn touching sapping snow, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The creature's hit point maximum decreases by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. If this effect reduces the creature's hit point maximum to 0, the creature dies, and its body immediately crumbles into sapping snow.

#### Shipwrecks

Shipwrecks at the bottom of the ocean make the perfect locations for monsters' lairs and lost treasures. The Shipwreck Contents table provides ideas for the creatures and treasure within these wrecks.

#### Whirlpools

In areas where storms or opposed currents drive powerful waters together, violent maelstroms might form. Whirlpools are difficult terrain. Each whirlpool has a rank, which determines its size and strength, as shown on the Whirlpool Rank table. A whirlpool's depth equals half its diameter.

##### Whirlpool Rank
| Rank | Diameter        | Velocity |  DC |
|:----:|-----------------|----------|:---:|
|   1  | 22 (4d10) ft.   | 5 ft.    |  5  |
|   2  | 55 (10d10) ft.  | 15 ft.   |  10 |
|   3  | 110 (20d10) ft. | 25 ft.   |  15 |
|   4  | 165 (30d10) ft. | 35 ft.   |  20 |

***Creatures in Whirlpools.*** ![](img/variantrules/GoS/097-za-07-p206.webp)

When a creature moves into a whirlpool or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC determined by the whirlpool's rank. On a success, the creature can move normally. On a failure, the creature is immediately moved toward the vortex's center at the whirlpool's velocity, and the creature is restrained by the whirlpool until the start of its next turn. If the creature reaches the whirlpool's center, the creature is pulled under the surface and either appears at a special location (see "*Whirlpool Destinations*" below) or plunges a number of feet underwater equal to the whirlpool's velocity.

***Vessels in Whirlpools.*** If a vessel starts its turn in a whirlpool with a diameter greater than the vessel's length, the ship's officers and crew must make a group check to escape. This group check works like the special ones made against hazards.

The group check represents 5 minutes of work. The check's DC is chosen or randomly determined by rolling a d4 on the Whirlpool Rank table. The captain, first mate, bosun, and quartermaster each make an ability check, as shown on the Whirlpool Checks table. If no one makes the check for a particular officer, a failure is contributed toward the group check. Also, roll a d20 for the crew, using its quality score as a modifier to the roll, and compare that check to the DC.

Determine how many of the group's checks succeeded—the officers' and the crew's—then consult the Whirlpool Check Results table.

##### Whirlpool Checks
| Officer       | Check                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Captain       | Intelligence (water vehicles)  |
| First mate    | Charisma (Intimidation)        |
| Bosun         | Strength (*carpenter's tools*) |
| Quartermaster | Wisdom (Nature)                |

##### Whirlpool Check Results
| Result        | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Total Success | The vessel uses the whirlpool to its advantage and increases its speed by 20 ft. during its current turn.                                                                                              |
| Success       | The vessel can move normally on its turn.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Failure       | The vessel is immediately moved toward the vortex's center at the whirlpool's velocity, and the vessel is restrained by the whirlpool until the start of its next turn.                                |
| Total Failure | As a failure. Additionally, if the vessel is in the whirlpool at the start of its next turn, all checks the vessel makes to determine the whirlpool's effects are made with disadvantage on that turn. |

***Whirlpool Destinations.*** While a whirlpool might be a short-lived hazard that drags things into the depths, they might also serve as a violent passage to another realm. In such cases, things dragged into a whirlpool are deposited elsewhere, be it through a crack in the seafloor leading to an Underdark ocean or a portal to a different plane of existence. Use the Whirlpool Destinations table to choose or randomly determine where a whirlpool leads, usually to a body of water in that destination. See *chapter 2* of the *Dungeon Master's Guide* for information about the destinations on other planes.

##### Whirlpool Destinations

## Encounters at Sea

The open seas provide endless opportunities for adventure. This section supplies you with a variety of random tables, perfect for detailing the challenges awaiting your characters on and beneath the waves.

#### Random Encounters

For each day of a voyage, in addition to checking for hazards, roll a d20. On a 19 or 20, the ship has a random encounter. If you roll both a hazard and a random encounter, the ship experiences both. They might occur simultaneously or in an order of your choice.

The levels given on the following tables allow you to sculpt what dangers the characters face. The low-level table is useful for when a ship travels in safe waters, while the higher-level ones are suited for primeval waters, far from well-trafficked sea lanes. The tables also allow for encounters with other ships and the discovery of mysterious, uncharted islands. Additional tables for further detailing such encounters are included later in this appendix.

##### Open Water Encounters (Levels 1–4)

## Random Ships

The characters aren't the only sailors traveling the high seas. Each new vessel they encounter presents an opportunity for adventure. The following rules can be used to generate other ships met on the open seas.

#### Ship Type

The type of ship the characters meet determines the vessel's statistics, along with how many creatures and how much cargo it can carry.

##### Ship Type
|  d100 | Ship         |
|:-----:|--------------|
| 01–09 | Rowboat      |
| 10–25 | Keelboat     |
| 26–38 | Longship     |
| 39–60 | Sailing ship |
| 61–79 | Galley       |
| 80–00 | Warship      |

#### Ship Name

Every ship has a name, which you can create yourself or randomly generate using the Ship Names table. Roll on the table—once for an adjective and once for a noun—to create a ship name.

##### Ship Names
| d20 | Adjective    | Noun      |
|:---:|--------------|-----------|
|  1  | Beautiful    | Adventure |
|  2  | Bilious      | Barnacle  |
|  3  | Bold         | Brawler   |
|  4  | Cold         | Devil     |
|  5  | Dandy        | Dragon    |
|  6  | Dawn         | Gem       |
|  7  | Drunken      | Flower    |
|  8  | Fiery        | Jester    |
|  9  | Furious      | Kraken    |
|  10 | Grinning     | Leviathan |
|  11 | Intrepid     | Mermaid   |
|  12 | Jolly        | Prince    |
|  13 | Misty        | Princess  |
|  14 | Rambunctious | Revenge   |
|  15 | Red          | Saber     |
|  16 | Royal        | Shark     |
|  17 | Salty        | Tide      |
|  18 | Sinful       | Treasure  |
|  19 | Twilight     | Victory   |
|  20 | Zealous      | Wanderer  |

#### Crew

Unless you decide otherwise, each ship encountered on the sea has its full crew and enough food and water to sustain that crew and any passengers for the duration of the ship's journey. You can generate a crew using the suggestions in the "*Ship Purpose*" section below or by using the suggested crew for a ship's type.

***Crew Member Names.*** Should you need to quickly generate the name of a member of a ship's crew, the following table makes it easy to produce a two-part name that could apply to any member of a crew, regardless of gender or race.

##### Crew Member Name
| d20 | First Half | Second Half |
|:---:|------------|-------------|
|  1  | Salty      | Beard       |
|  2  | Ol'        | Eye         |
|  3  | Silver     | Copper      |
|  4  | Golden     | Fish        |
|  5  | Black      | Whale       |
|  6  | Blue       | Dog         |

|  19 | Mad        | Maps        |
|  20 | Poor       | Mast        |

#### Ship Purpose

Every ship has a reason for its voyages, which can be rolled or chosen on the Ship Purpose table. Each purpose is described after the table.

##### Ship Purpose
|  d100 | Purpose   |
|:-----:|-----------|
| 01–17 | Cargo     |
| 18–34 | Passenger |
| 35–51 | Fishing   |
| 52–68 | Military  |
| 69–85 | Piracy    |
| 86–95 | Mercenary |
| 96–00 | Ghost     |

***Cargo.*** Cargo ships haul mercantile goods, emergency relief supplies, traveling carnivals, and any other materials that need to move across the seas. Let the ship's alignment, racial makeup, and disposition guide what a ship might carry as cargo.

Most crew members and officers on cargo ships are **commoners**. Vessels with valuable cargo may carry 2d10 **guards** with a **veteran** guard captain. Cargo ships that transport livestock may have **goats**, **camels**, **draft horses**, **mules**, and other beasts, in addition to their crews and passengers.

***Passenger.*** Passenger ships carry travelers. Such vessels are chartered for journeys or pleasure cruises or carry refugees, religious missionaries, or some other peaceful group traveling to an important destination.

Most crew members and officers on passenger ships are **commoners**. Vessels carrying important people may carry 2d10 **guards** with a **veteran** guard captain. The passengers on a passenger ship generally consist of **commoners** and **nobles**, though many creatures have the need to travel by ship.

***Fishing.*** Fishing ships include commercial vessels that catch fish and crustaceans to sell at market, whaling boats, and trophy hunters stalking sharks, giant octopuses, and other sea monsters. Any vessel that hunts sea life for profit, survival, or sport has this purpose.

Most crew members and officers on commercial fishing ships are **commoners**, but whaling vessels and sport hunters often have **scouts** among their ranks.

***Military.*** Military vessels carry soldiers to war and are equipped for battle on the sea. These vessels hunt pirates, defend and invade territory, carry important government cargo, escort officials, transport prisoners, and do anything else their commanders require.

Most crew members on military ships are **guards** or **scouts**. Officers are **veterans**. Many military ships carry extra **guards** as passengers for invasion, boarding, and operating siege weapons. A military ship may also carry 1d4 **bandits** or **guards** as prisoners.

***Piracy.*** Pirates smuggle contraband goods and rob other ships, seaside towns, and outposts. They engage in criminal operations, but not all are evil. Many have an ethical code. Some serve governments as privateers, harming only these masters' adversaries, while others rob only the corrupt and give their ill-gotten gains to the needy.

Most crew members on pirate ships are **bandits**. Officers are **bandit captains** and could include a **pirate captain** (see *appendix C*) and a **pirate bosun** (see *appendix C*). Many pirate ships carry extra **bandits** and at least one **pirate deck wizard** (see *appendix C*) as passengers.

***Mercenary.*** Mercenary crews travel the world in search of adventure and pay. They explore uncharted territories, fight wars, slay monsters, transport special cargo or people, and undertake any quest for the right cost.

Mercenary ships have crews and passengers similar to military ships.

![](img/variantrules/GoS/098-za-08-ghost-ship-p210.webp)

***Ghost.*** Ghost ships are incorporeal vessels that carry undead crews. The crews often died in a grisly manner and have unfinished business that keeps them tethered to the Material Plane. They sometimes serve necromancers, but more often these crews are beholden to no master.

A ghost ship has the same statistics as a normal ship of its ship type with the following changes:

- The ship has resistance to the following damage types: acid, fire, lightning, and thunder, as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks.
- The ship is immune to cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.
- The ship can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

Crew members and officers on good and neutral ghost ships are **ghosts**. On evil ghost ships, the crew members are 90 percent **skeletons** and **zombies** (even mix of each), 10 percent are **specters**, and the officers are **wraiths**.

#### Attitude and Race

Each ship's crew and passengers have an attitude that guides how they interact with the characters. Friendly ships seek to trade or share news, neutral ones attack if they feel threatened and otherwise try to avoid contact, and hostile ones seek to attack and seize the characters' ship.

First, roll or choose an attitude on the Ship Attitude table, then roll on the appropriate table to determine the nature of the crew. The race chosen or rolled need not be the only one found on the ship, and you might use a table multiple times to make a ship's crew and passengers more diverse. Feel free to substitute suggested statistics for other statistics if you feel they make more sense with the ship's race (for example, substituting the **bandit** statistics with **orc** statistics on a pirate ship crewed by orcs).

##### Ship Attitude
|  d6 | Attitude |
|:---:|----------|
| 1–2 | Friendly |
| 3–4 | Neutral  |
| 5–6 | Hostile  |

##### Friendly Ship
|  d100 | Race       |
|:-----:|------------|
| 01–05 | Dragonborn |
| 06–10 | Dwarves    |
| 11–30 | Elves      |
| 31–40 | Gnomes     |
| 41–50 | Tieflings  |
| 51–60 | Halflings  |
| 61–00 | Humans     |

##### Neutral Ship
|  d100 | Race       |
|:-----:|------------|
| 01–05 | Dragonborn |
| 06–10 | Dwarves    |
| 11–30 | Lizardfolk |
| 31–40 | Hobgoblins |
| 41–50 | Orcs       |
| 51–60 | Halflings  |
| 61–00 | Humans     |

##### Hostile Ship
|  d100 | Race         |
|:-----:|--------------|
| 01–05 | Frost giants |
| 06–10 | Kobolds      |
| 11–30 | Orcs         |
| 31–40 | Hobgoblins   |
| 41–50 | Undead       |
| 51–60 | Gnolls       |
| 61–00 | Humans       |

***Ship Disposition.*** Each ship has a disposition that determines events happening aboard the ship when the characters encounter it. Choose or roll for a ship's disposition on the Ship Disposition table. Each disposition is described after the table. If you roll no special disposition, the ship is under no unusual stress and reacts based on its attitude.

##### Ship Disposition
|  d10 | Disposition            |
|:----:|------------------------|
|   1  | Diseased               |
|   2  | Emergency              |
|   3  | Help with purpose      |
|   4  | Mutiny                 |
|   5  | Trading                |
| 6–10 | No special disposition |

***Diseased.*** Roll percentile dice. The result reveals the percentage of the ship's crew and passengers infected with a disease of your choice from "*Sample Diseases*" in chapter 8, "*Running the Game*," of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. This ship approaches the characters, begging for or demanding help with the infection.

Ghost ships can't be diseased; if you get this result for a ghost ship, ignore it and roll again.

***Emergency.*** A ship experiencing an emergency is suffering some sort of crisis. The crew and passengers beg or demand the characters' help in getting out of the situation. Choose or roll for an emergency on the Ship Emergency table to determine the vessel's crisis.

##### Ship Emergency
|  d4 | Emergency                                                               |
|:---:|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1  | The ship's crew is lost.                                                |
|  2  | The ship is damaged and can't be steered as it drifts with the current. |
|  3  | The ship is stuck on a sandbar.                                         |
|  4  | The ship is sinking.                                                    |

***Help with Purpose.*** Ship crews looking for help with their purpose approach the characters asking for direct aid in a task. For instance, mercenaries ask for help mapping an unexplored area while a cargo ship's crew asks the characters to serve as guards. Most crews offer compensation in return for the characters' services, though some might threaten or beg for charity to get help.

***Mutiny.*** The crew of ships ready to mutiny are unhappy with the leadership of their officers and plan to overthrow them. The officers approach the characters, asking for or demanding help quelling the uprising, or the crew approaches, requesting aid with their uprising or attempting to trick the characters into killing the officers.

***Trading.*** Ship crews and passengers looking to trade offer their cargo or services to the characters in exchange for deeds, items, or coin. Use the ship's purpose to guide what they have to trade. For instance, commercial fishermen might offer a crate of valuable crabs in exchange for the head of a shark that keeps consuming their catches, while pirates might offer stolen potions in exchange for gems or gold. Most of the people offering trades are willing to haggle. If the characters refuse to trade, evil-aligned crews and passengers might attack to get what they want.

## Familiars

Any spellcaster that can cast the *find familiar* spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the *Player's Handbook*) or some other Tiny monster, such as a **crawling claw**, an **imp**, a **pseudodragon**, or a **quasit**.

*This variant is [https://twitter.com/JeremyECrawford/status/920714594334654465](intended for NPCs.)*

---

## Encumbrance

The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table in *chapter 5*.

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

---

## Downtime Activity: Training to Gain Levels

As a variant rule, you can require characters to spend downtime training or studying before they gain the benefits of a new level. If you choose this option, once a character has earned enough experience points to attain a new level, he or she must train for a number of days before gaining any class features associated with the new level.

The training time required depends on the level to be gained, as shown on the Training to Gain Levels table. The training cost is for the total training time.

##### Training to Gain Levels
| Level Attained | Training Time | Training Cost |
|:--------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|     2nd-4th    |    10 days    |     20 gp     |
|    5th-10th    |    20 days    |     40 gp     |
|    11th-16th   |    30 days    |     60 gp     |
|    17th-20th   |    40 days    |     80 gp     |

## Downtime Activity: Sowing Rumors

Swaying public opinion can be an effective way to bring down a villain or elevate a friend. Spreading rumors is an efficient, if underhanded, way to accomplish that goal. Well-placed rumors can increase the subject's standing in a community or embroil someone in scandal. A rumor needs to be simple, concrete, and hard to disprove. An effective rumor also has to be believable, playing off what people want to believe about the person in question.

Sowing a rumor about an individual or organization requires a number of days depending on the size of the community, as shown in the Sowing Rumors table. In a town or city, the time spent must be continuous. If the character spreads a rumor for ten days, disappears on an adventure for another few days and then returns, the rumor fades away without the benefit of constant repetition.

##### Sowing Rumors
| Settlement Size | Time Required |
|:---------------:|:-------------:|
|     Village     |    2d6 days   |
|       Town      |    4d6 days   |
|       City      |    6d6 days   |

The character must spend 1 gp per day to cover the cost of drinks, social appearances, and the like. At the end of the time spent sowing the rumor, the character must make a DC 15 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the community's prevailing attitude toward the subject shifts one step toward friendly or hostile, as the character wishes. If the check fails, the rumor gains no traction, and further attempts to propagate it fail.

Shifting a community's general attitude toward a person or organization doesn't affect everyone in the community. Individuals might hold to their own opinions, particularly if they have personal experience in dealing with the subject of the rumors.

## Downtime Activity: Selling Magic Items

Few people can afford to buy a magic item, and fewer still know how to find one. Adventurers are exceptional in this regard due to the nature of their profession.

A character who comes into possession of a common, uncommon, rare, or very rare magic item that he or she wants to sell can spend downtime searching for a buyer. This downtime activity can be performed only in a city or another location where one can find wealthy individuals interested in buying magic items. Legendary magic items and priceless artifacts can't be sold during downtime. Finding someone to buy such an item can be the substance of an adventure or quest.

For each salable item, the character makes a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find buyers. Another character can use his or her downtime to assist with the search, granting advantage on the checks. On a failed check, no buyer for the item is found after a search that lasts 10 days. On a successful check, a buyer for the item is found after a number of days based on the item's rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic Item table.

A character can attempt to find buyers for multiple magic items at once. Although this requires multiple Intelligence (Investigation) checks, the searches are occurring simultaneously, and the results of multiple failures or successes aren't added together. For example, if the character finds a buyer for a common magic item in 2 days and a buyer for an uncommon item in 5 days, but fails to find a buyer for a rare item up for grabs, the entire search takes 10 days.

For each item a character wishes to sell, the player rolls percentile dice and consults the Selling a Magic Item table, applying a modifier based on the item's rarity, as shown in the Salable Magic Items table. The character also makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check and adds that check's total to the roll. The subsequent total determines what a buyer offers to pay for the item.

You determine a buyer's identity. Buyers sometimes procure rare and very rare items through proxies to ensure that their identities remain unknown. If the buyer is shady, it's up to you whether the sale creates legal complications for the party later.

##### Salable Magic Items
| Rarity    | Base Price | Days to Find Buyer | d100 Roll Modifier* |

## Downtime Activity: Running a Business

Adventurers can end up owning businesses that have nothing to do with delving into dungeons or saving the world. A character might inherit a smithy, or the party might be given a parcel of farmland or a tavern as a reward. If they hold on to the business, they might feel obliged to spend time between adventures maintaining the venture and making sure it runs smoothly.

A character rolls percentile dice and adds the number of days spent on this downtime activity (maximum 30), then compares the total to the Running a Business table to determine what happens.

If the character is required to pay a cost as a result of rolling on this table but fails to do so, the business begins to fail. For each unpaid debt incurred in this manner, the character takes a -10 penalty to subsequent rolls made on this table.

##### Running a Business

## Downtime Activity: Performing Sacred Rites

A pious character can spend time between adventures performing sacred rites in a temple affiliated with a god he or she reveres. Between rites, the character spends time in meditation and prayer.

A character who is a priest in the temple can lead these rites, which might include weddings, funerals, and ordinations. A layperson can offer sacrifices in a temple or assist a priest with a rite.

A character who spends at least 10 days performing sacred rites gains *inspiration* (described in chapter 4 of the *Player's Handbook*) at the start of each day for the next 2d6 days.

---

## Downtime Activity: Gaining Renown

A character can spend downtime improving his or her renown within a particular organization (see "Renown" in chapter 1). Between adventures, a character undertakes minor tasks for the organization and socializes with its members. After pursuing these activities for a combined number of days equal to his or her current renown multiplied by 10, the character's renown increases by 1.

## Downtime Activity: Crafting a Magic Item

Magic items are the DM's purview, so you decide how they fall into the party's possession. As an option, you can allow player characters to craft magic items.

The creation of a magic item is a lengthy, expensive task. To start, a character must have a formula that describes the construction of the item. The character must also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must be able to cast any spells that the item can produce. Moreover, the character must meet a level minimum determined by the item's rarity, as shown in the Crafting Magic Items table. For example, a 3rd-level character could create a *wand of magic missiles* (an uncommon item), as long as the character has spell slots and can cast *magic missile*. That same character could make a *+1 weapon* (another uncommon item), no particular spell required.

You can decide that certain items also require special materials or locations to be created. For example, a character might need *alchemist's supplies* to brew a particular potion, or the formula for a *flame tongue* might require that the weapon be forged with lava.

##### Crafting Magic Items
| Item Rarity | Creation Cost | Minimum Level |
|-------------|--------------:|:-------------:|
| Common      |        100 gp |      3rd      |
| Uncommon    |        500 gp |      3rd      |
| Rare        |      5,000 gp |      6th      |
| Very rare   |     50,000 gp |      11th     |
| Legendary   |    500,000 gp |      17th     |

An item has a creation cost specified in the Crafting Magic Items table. A character engaged in the crafting of a magic item makes progress in 25 gp increments, spending that amount for each day of work until the total cost is paid. The character is assumed to work for 8 hours each of those days. Thus, creating an uncommon magic item takes 20 days and 500 gp. You are free to adjust the costs to better suit your campaign.

If a spell will be produced by the item being created, the creator must expend one spell slot of the spell's level for each day of the creation process. The spell's material components must also be at hand throughout the process. If the spell normally consumes those components, they are consumed by the creation process. If the item will be able to produce the spell only once, as with a *spell scroll*, the components are consumed only once by the process. Otherwise, the components are consumed once each day of the item's creation.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts to create a magic item if each of them meets the level prerequisite. Each character can contribute spells, spell slots and components, as long as everyone participates during the entire crafting process. Each character can contribute 25 gp worth of effort for each day spent helping to craft the item.

Normally, a character who undertakes this activity creates a magic item described in chapter 7, "Treasure." At your discretion, you can allow players to design their own magic items, using the guidelines in chapter 9, "Dungeon Master's Workshop."

While crafting a magic item, a character can maintain modest lifestyle without having to pay the 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5, "*Equipment*," of the *Player's Handbook*).

> ##### Magic Item Formulas
>
>A magic item formula explains how to make a particular magic item. Such a formula can be an excellent reward if you allow player characters to craft magic items.
>
>You can award a formula in place of a magic item. Usually written in a book or on a scroll, a formula is one step rarer than the item it allows a character to create. For example, the formula for a common magic item is uncommon. No formulas exist for legendary items.
>
>If the creation of magic items is commonplace in your campaign, a formula can have a rarity that matches the rarity of the item it allows a character to create. Formulas for common and uncommon items might even be for sale, each with a cost double that of its magic item.

## Downtime Activity: Carousing

Characters can spend their downtime engaged in a variety of hedonistic activities such as attending parties, binge drinking, gambling, or anything else that helps them cope with the perils they face on their adventures.

A carousing character spends money as though maintaining a wealthy lifestyle (see chapter 5, "*Equipment*," of the *Player's Handbook*). At the end of the period spent carousing, the player rolls percentile dice and adds the character's level, then compares the total to the Carousing table to determine what happens to the character, or you choose.

##### Carousing
| d100 + Level | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Downtime Activity: Building a Stronghold

A character can spend time between adventures building a stronghold. Before work can begin, the character must acquire a plot of land. If the estate lies within a kingdom or similar domain, the character will need a royal charter (a legal document granting permission to oversee the estate in the name of the crown), a land grant (a legal document bequeathing custody of the land to the character for as long as he or she remains loyal to the crown), or a deed (a legal document that serves as proof of ownership). Land can also be acquired by inheritance or other means.

Royal charters and land grants are usually given by the crown as a reward for faithful service, although they can also be bought. Deeds can be bought or inherited. A small estate might sell for as little as 100 gp or as much as 1,000 gp. A large estate might cost 5,000 gp or more, if it can be bought at all.

Once the estate is secured, a character needs access to building materials and laborers. The Building a Stronghold table shows the cost of building the stronghold (including materials and labor) and the amount of time it takes, provided that the character is using downtime to oversee construction. Work can continue while the character is away, but each day the character is away adds 3 days to the construction time.

##### Building a Stronghold
