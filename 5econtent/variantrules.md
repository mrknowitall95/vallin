## Sleep

Just as in the real world, D&D characters spend many hours sleeping, most often as part of a long rest. Most monsters also need to sleep. While a creature sleeps, it is subjected to the unconscious condition. Here are a few rules that expand on that basic fact.

#### Waking Someone

A creature that is naturally sleeping, as opposed to being in a magically or chemically induced sleep, wakes up if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake. A sudden loud noise—such as yelling, thunder, or a ringing bell—also awakens someone that is sleeping naturally.

Whispers don't disturb sleep, unless a sleeper's passive Wisdom (Perception) score is 20 or higher and the whispers are within 10 feet of the sleeper. Speech at a normal volume awakens a sleeper if the environment is otherwise silent (no wind, birdsong, crickets, street sounds, or the like) and the sleeper has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher.

#### Sleeping in Armor

Sleeping in light armor has no adverse effect on the wearer, but sleeping in medium or heavy armor makes it difficult to recover fully during a long rest.

When you finish a long rest during which you slept in medium or heavy armor, you regain only one quarter of your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one die). If you have any levels of exhaustion, the rest doesn't reduce your exhaustion level.

#### Going without a Long Rest

A long rest is never mandatory, but going without sleep does have its consequences.

Whenever you end a 24-hour period without finishing a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion.

It becomes harder to fight off exhaustion if you stay awake for multiple days. After the first 24 hours, the DC increases by 5 for each consecutive 24-hour period without a long rest. The DC resets to 10 when you finish a long rest.

## Magic Item Identification

The *identify* spell and/or experimentation are required to reveal what a magic item does.

---

## Mixing Potions

If you drink one potion while still under the effects of another, or pour several potions into a single container, the strange ingredients used in creating potions can result in unpredictable interactions.

---

## Wands Don't Recharge

Wands are incapable of regaining charges, the base number of charges in each wand is between 15 and 25 depending on the wand's effect. These charges are never regained once they're expended.

---

## Fear, Horror, and Madness

In a typical campaign, characters can become **frightened** temporarily, but aren't typically driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day. But now, the stress of being an adventurer can sometimes be too much to bear, and if they encounter something too frightening for their mind to handle, it can cause them to experience **horror**, or even **madness**. And there can be a *lot* of potentially horrifying and threatening creatures and magical plane 

#### Going Mad

Various magical effects and creature encounters can now possibly inflict madness on you. Any spells or effects that mention causing **insanity**, are replaced by **madness** instead. Some diseases, poisons, and powerful effects can inflict madness as well.

#### Madness

The exact effects that you experience durring the madness can vary, and are determined by rolling on a table that is decided after you make a check or saving throw. 

Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects cause short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness, which requires healing or restorative magic to fully cure.

## Sanity

A character with high Sanity is level-headed even in the face of insane circumstances, while a character with low Sanity is unsteady, breaking easily when confronted by horrors that are beyond normal reason.

***Sanity Checks.*** You might be asked to make make a Sanity check in place of various Intelligence or Wisdom checks when it is for something that will  madness. 

***Sanity Saving Throws.*** Your have to make a Sanity saving throw when your character runs the risk of succumbing to madness, such as in the following situations:

- Seeing a horrifying creature from and alien realm for the first time.
- Making direct contact with the mind of a powerful alien creature.
- Being subjected to spells that affect mental stability.
- Passing through a plane with alien physics.

A failed Sanity save might result in short-term, long-term, or indefinite madness. Any time you suffer from long-term or indefinite madness, your character's Sanity score is reduced by 1. A *greater restoration* spell can restore Sanity lost in this way, and you can't increase your Sanity score through level advancement.

#### Starting Sanity Score

When you create your character, the base starting Sanity score is 10, and the character options you choose will determine any modifiers to that score.

## Spell Points

Spell Points are the shit, if you didn't know, and completely optional to use and seamlessly convertible to Spell Slots so long as you aren't afraid of math! The limitation with Points is that levels 6-9 only allow one casting per long rest, which is the same as Spell Slots until you get to level 18.

## Ship Stat Blocks

To aid in running adventures where ships engage in combat, undertake precise navigation, or face situations where their various capabilities become relevant, the following section presents new rules and stat blocks for a spectrum of vessels.

#### Basic Statistics

A ship stat block has three main parts: basic statistics, components, and action options. Ships can't take any actions on their own. Without effort from its crew, a ship might drift on the water, come to a stop, or careen out of control.

***Size.*** Most ships are Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. A ship's size category is determined by its length or width, whichever is longer. For instance, a ship that is 10 feet long and 20 feet wide would use the size category that has a 20-foot width, which means the ship is Gargantuan.

***Space.*** A ship doesn't have a square space unless its stat block specifies otherwise. For example, a ship that is 20 feet long and 10 feet wide occupies a 20-by-10-foot space.

A ship can't move into a space that is too small to accommodate it. If it tries to do so, it crashes, as described in the "Crashing a Ship" section.

***Capacity.*** A ship's stat block indicates how many creatures and how much cargo it can carry. Creatures include both the crew of the vessel and any passengers who might ride along. Passengers don't generally engage in running a ship, but they also don't need to be mere bystanders. Seasick merchants and marines thoroughly capable of facing menaces from the deep both count as passengers.

Cargo capacity notes the maximum amount of cargo a ship can carry. A vessel can't move—or might even start taking on water—if its cargo exceeds this capacity.

***Travel Pace.*** A ship's travel pace determines how far the vessel can move per hour and per day. A ship's movement-related components (described later in the stat block) determine how far the vessel can move each round.

***Ability Scores.*** A ship has the six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and the corresponding modifiers.

The Strength of a ship expresses its size and weight. Dexterity represents a ship's ease of handling. A ship's Constitution covers its durability and the quality of its construction. Ships usually have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

If a ship has a 0 in a score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that uses that score.

***Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities.*** A ship's vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities apply to all its components, unless otherwise noted in the stat block.

Ships are typically immune to poison and psychic damage. Ships are also usually immune to the following conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, stunned, and unconscious.

#### Actions

This part of the stat block specifies what the ship can do on its turn, using its special actions rather than the actions used by creatures. It even relies on its actions to move; it doesn't have a move otherwise. The ship's captain decides which actions to use. A given action can be chosen only once during a turn.

#### Components

A ship is composed of different components, each of which comprises multiple objects:

**Hull**. A ship's hull is its basic frame, on which the other components are mounted.

**Control**. A control component is used to steer a ship.

**Movement**. A movement component is the element of the ship that enables it to move, such as a set of sails or oars, and has a specific speed.

**Weapon**. A ship capable of being used in combat has one or more weapon components, each of which is operated separately.

A ship's component might have special rules, as described in the stat block.

***Armor Class.*** A component has an Armor Class. Its AC reflects the materials used to construct it and any defensive plating used to augment its toughness.

***Hit Points.*** A ship component is destroyed and becomes unusable when it drops to 0 hit points. A ship is wrecked if its hull is destroyed.

A ship doesn't have Hit Dice.

***Damage Threshold.*** If a ship component has a damage threshold, that threshold appears after its hit points. A component has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage that equals or exceeds its threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Damage that fails to bypass the threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the component's hit points.

#### Sample Ships

See the [vehicles.html](vehicles page) for stat blocks, deck plans, and other details for some of the most common ships.

- Galley
- Keelboat
- Longship
- Rowboat
- Sailing Ship
- Warship

> ##### Siege Weapons
>
>Some ships are armed with siege weapons, the descriptions of which are in the "*Siege Equipment*" section of chapter 8 in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. In this appendix, the name of a piece of siege equipment appears in bold with a parenthetical note (*DMG, ch. 8*), reminding you where to find the object's description.

## Familiars

Any spellcaster that can cast the *find familiar* spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the *Player's Handbook*) or some other Tiny monster, such as a **crawling claw**, an **imp**, a **pseudodragon**, or a **quasit**.

*This variant is [https://twitter.com/JeremyECrawford/status/920714594334654465](intended for NPCs.)*

## Encumbrance

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
